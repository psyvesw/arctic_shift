    "selftext": "I hope this is an appropriate post here. Not used AI tools much before, so feel free to assume I'm very stupid.\n\nMy partner is a childcare worker, and part of his job is writing 'observations' on each child's developmental progress each week. It's important, but massively challenging to do when you're trying to keep a dozen 3 year olds happy and safe at the same time. Child safety standards mean he's not allowed to have his phone with him, so instead he uses an old-school handheld digital voice recorder to capture his thoughts throughout the day.\n\nTo help get his reporting done quicker, I'm wondering how AI could provide some shortcuts. What he needs is:\n1. Transcription of recordings. His voice recorder is pretty ancient. I'm sure it's possible to download the recordings, but it might be quicker to use a tool that can transcribe from the audio playback. \n2. Separate the observations by child. Information about Abby needs to be separated from notes about Robert. What voice cues should he remember to include when he's recording his thoughts? What tools or prompts are good for this?\n3. Summarise the observations with reference to learning guidelines. There's a national learning framework that the observations need to link to, and each quarter, each child is assigned a priority learning theme area (e.g. affirming personal identity) to work towards. \n\nAlso, I should add that I realise personal information security is super important here. He is always very careful not to include identifying or other sensitive information in his voice memos and they are erased at the end of each week, but will obviously have to be extra cautious if that information is going into AI systems.\n\nAny advice or suggestions gratefully received.\n",
