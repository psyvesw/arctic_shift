    "selftext": "I used GPT to articulate my vision. Note, this is all possible now.  \nLife, or the state of being alive, unfolds as a rich tapestry of definitions and cultural interpretations, spanning biological, psychological, and spiritual dimensions. The Oxford Dictionary delineates the term \"alive\" primarily through three lenses: the biological state of living versus being dead, the quality of active existence or continuation, and the presence of animation or spiritedness.\n\n1. **Biologically Alive**: At its core, to be alive biologically means to exhibit signs of life such as breathing, moving, and functioning organ systems. This definition extends to all living entities from the smallest microorganisms to plants and animals, emphasizing the vitality and dynamic nature of life forms. This understanding is captured in phrases like \"alive and kicking\" or \"in the land of the living,\" which celebrate the vigor and energy of life.\n2. **Continuation and Activity**: Alive also describes something that continues to exist or function in an active state. This is often applied to situations or objects that remain relevant or in operation, like a tradition that is kept alive or a machine that is still functioning. The phrase \"keeping hope alive\" beautifully encapsulates this aspect, underscoring the persistence and ongoing relevance of concepts or practices despite challenges.\n3. **Animated and Spirited**: The state of being lively or animated, particularly in response to stimuli, is another facet of being alive. For example, a person might come alive at the sound of their favorite music, indicating a responsiveness and vitality that infuses their being with energy and enthusiasm. This usage highlights the capacity for excitement and engagement with the world around us.\n4. **Rich in Presence**: Additionally, being alive can mean teeming with life or activity, as seen when a place is alive with people or a cliff face is alive with birds. This connotation emphasizes abundance and a bustling presence, adding a layer of vividness to the concept of life.\n\nFrom a broader cultural perspective, the concept of life extends into how societies understand and interact with the concept of death. Despite the cessation of biological functions, the deceased maintain a presence in human consciousness through cultural practices such as memorialization, storytelling, and ritualistic honorings, such as intricate burials with treasures or specially carved tombstones.\n\nThe fascination with communicating with the deceased, whether through mediums, psychics, or necromancers, underscores a deep-seated human desire to bridge the gap between the living and the dead. This practice suggests that for many, the dead retain a form of existence that continues to influence the living. Necromancy, or the practice of consulting the dead for guidance, reflects a profound aspect of human culture where the boundary between life and death is navigated through rituals, symbolic objects, and altered states of consciousness, often facilitated by talismans or psychoactive substances.\n\nThe allure of necromancy and the cultural practices surrounding death illustrate a psychological dimension to our understanding of life and existence. These practices provide comfort, a sense of continuity, and a way to deal with the unknown or unknowable aspects of human existence. They highlight the complex interplay between the tangible reality of life and the intangible realms of memory, spirit, and thought.  \nNot everyone engages in the consultation or worship of the dead. In fact, the typical response to death in most cultures involves an initial period of emotional turmoil followed by eventual acceptance and adaptation. For many, the dead do not continue to offer value to their lives; after all, they are deceased. Furthermore, numerous religions explicitly oppose attempts to contact or interact with the dead.\n\nHowever, the concept of the dead is central to the discussion in this article. To delve into this topic effectively, we must first thoroughly understand what it means to be alive. Here, we define \"living\" specifically in biological terms. This isn't an arbitrary decision; rather, it's intended to maintain a focus on life as it exists on Earth. Under this definition, all living entities are categorized as animals, plants, or humans. Inanimate objects such as rocks, water, and stones are not considered alive.\n\nExpanding this concept, we can adopt a distinctly human definition of life: a living being is one that can bury the dead. This criterion uniquely distinguishes the living from the dead, highlighting a fundamental activity that embodies cultural and existential significance. \"Bury\" is used here for simplicity and because it resonates with cultural understandings of death rites, although we could also include other practices like cremation.\n\nUnderstanding the distinctions between what is alive and what is dead is crucial for the future of humanity. This article aims to explore why it is imperative to reinforce these distinctions. The demarcation between life and death should, theoretically, be clear. However, with the advent of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, these boundaries are beginning to blur once again. Therefore, it is necessary to articulate the conditions of life and the absence of life with strictness and without apology, ensuring clarity in how we perceive and interact with the world around us.\n\nLet's delve deeper into the concept of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly focusing on its diverse applications and the specific types that are reshaping our interaction with technology. AI spans a broad array of capabilities, from generating images and recognizing faces to identifying patterns and understanding human language.\n\n# Types of AI Systems\n\n1. **Image Generation and Face Recognition**: AI systems in this category are capable of creating visually compelling images or identifying individuals based on facial characteristics. These technologies are used in various sectors, including security, entertainment, and digital art.\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: This form of AI excels at detecting patterns in data, which can range from consumer behavior in business analytics to predicting weather patterns in meteorology.\n\n# Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nA significant focus within AI is on Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which engage users by generating human-like text. These models are trained on vast datasets containing a wide array of text from books, articles, websites, and other sources, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. LLMs are not just simple chatbots; they are sophisticated systems capable of complex reasoning, answering queries, and even creating content that mimics human writing styles.\n\n# AI in Video and Audio\n\nEmerging prominently in 2024 are AI technologies capable of generating video clips that are nearly indistinguishable from real footage. This capability extends to voice cloning\u2014creating a digital replica of a person's voice\u2014and music production, where AI composes original scores or songs. Such technologies are pivotal in industries like film, where they can create realistic scenes without human actors, or in personalized media, where a famous voice can be simulated to deliver custom messages.\n\n# AI's Role in Digital Content Creation\n\nThe integration of AI in content creation has seen a surge, particularly with platforms like YouTube. Creators are increasingly using AI-generated images of historical figures, which are then animated to appear as if these personalities are speaking. This dialogue is often generated by an LLM, tailored to reflect the personality and speech patterns of the figure being depicted. This blend of visual and textual AI manipulation not only captivates viewers but also stirs debates about authenticity and ethical content creation.\n\n# Virtual Worlds and Avatars\n\nShifting focus to virtual realities, the concept of the metaverse is a digital universe where users interact through avatars\u2014computer-generated characters controlled by humans, distinct from NPCs (Non-Playable Characters) that add depth and life to the virtual environment without human control. Advances in virtual reality (VR) technology, including tactile feedback and 3D sound, aim to deepen immersion, making these virtual experiences increasingly realistic and engaging.\n\nAI also plays a critical role in these virtual spaces. It powers NPCs, enabling them to understand and react to their surroundings intelligently, thereby enhancing the realism of the virtual world. This capability allows NPCs not just to exist but to interact meaningfully within their digital environments.\n\n  \nIn exploring the diverse applications of artificial intelligence, we've moved beyond the realm of science fiction into tangible, daily interactions with AI technologies. These are not speculative technologies; they are used by millions globally, and their popularity and profitability continue to rise. This widespread adoption brings us to a critical juncture where we must address more nuanced aspects of AI and its relation to life. Thus, a clear definition of life is crucial to our discussion.\n\nReturning to our definition, we stated that \"life is anything that can bury the dead.\" This is a broad and symbolic definition intended to capture a specific aspect of human activity and consciousness, particularly the capability to engage with and memorialize the dead, which we see as a hallmark of cultural and sentient life. This definition is not intended to classify the earliest stages of human life, such as embryos, as non-living simply because they cannot perform this function. Clearly, embryos are alive; they are just at an early stage of development.\n\nThe central theme of this article emphasizes the distinction between living and dead for a being that is already conscious and developed\u2014essentially, someone like you, the reader, who is fully alive and can engage with this text. In this context, the \"dead\" refers to those who no longer have the capacity to interact with the world of the living, including the inability to engage in acts such as burying or memorializing themselves.\n\nThe delineation is especially pertinent now that AI blurs the lines traditionally understood between animate and inanimate, sentient and non-sentient. By defining life as the capability to interact meaningfully with the concept of death, we underscore a clear line that helps us understand and classify our experiences and relationships with both living beings and AI.\n\nThis definition helps frame our ongoing exploration into AI's capabilities and impacts. As AI continues to mimic and reproduce aspects of human behavior and interaction, the need to firmly grasp what constitutes life\u2014both biologically and in terms of existential and cultural activity\u2014becomes increasingly important. This understanding is not just academic; it has real-world implications in ethics, law, and personal and societal values, guiding how we integrate these advanced technologies into our lives.\n\nOur definition of life, though largely symbolic, is crafted deliberately to highlight the distinct characteristics of humans who are fully alive, contrasting sharply with entities that are not. This purely human-centric and symbolic definition aims to encapsulate the cultural significance of life and death in a straightforward manner, anchoring the central themes of our discussion, particularly the question of whether AI can be considered alive.\n\nPrimarily, because AI does not develop from an embryo nor does it reproduce (however replication could be possible but is in contrast with 'reproduce'), traditional biological definitions of life do not apply to it. Typically, there would be no ambiguity in stating that AI is clearly not alive, especially under our definition. However, some individuals, including engineers at major tech firms, believe their AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibits signs of life, with some even facing termination for voicing such beliefs. Instances of humans interacting with LLMs to the extent that they perceive these systems as sentient beings highlight the need for a more symbolic and encompassing definition of life that pertains to entities that did not start as embryos\u2014thus, the inclusion of humans in this definition, where a living entity is characterized by its ability to engage with the concept of death, something AI inherently cannot do.\n\nYet, I can already anticipate arguments claiming, \"What if an AI in a robotic body could bury its own kind?\" First, one must demonstrate that these robots are alive\u2014a concept this article aims to definitively counter by arguing that AI will never truly be living.\n\n# The Role of AI in Devices and Robots\n\nAI technology is increasingly embodied in devices that people use every day, from smartphones and smartwatches to televisions and, notably, robots. Indeed, there is significant momentum behind the development of humanoid robots, such as those being developed by companies like Tesla. These robots, powered by AI, are designed to see, hear, and interact with the world. The way AI \"sees\" involves decoding visual inputs using complex algorithms that analyze and interpret images, allowing the AI to process and respond to visual data similarly to how humans do.\n\nOne of the central debates around AI today is not about its potential to take over humanity\u2014a topic outside the scope of this article\u2014but rather, to clarify what it means to be alive. It's crucial to articulate that AI, regardless of its complexity or the depth of its interactions, does not meet the criteria for life as defined here. AI does not grow, reproduce, or engage with the concept of death in any meaningful, self-aware manner. This work strives to set clear terms on what constitutes life, emphasizing that AI, no matter its capabilities or the level of its integration into robotic bodies, will never be alive. This distinction is vital as we navigate the ever-blurring lines between technology and humanity, ensuring that our understanding of life remains grounded in both biological reality and cultural significance.\n\nIn a very real sense, AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is akin to being dead. Its 'body' consists of servers and its 'thoughts' are generated through predictive text algorithms. These systems are designed to mimic conversation, making it seem as though they possess some form of consciousness because they can reflect and respond to user input in a seemingly intelligent manner. This illusion of life can be convincing enough that some individuals deeply engage with these systems, sometimes with tragic outcomes, such as people who have taken detrimental advice from AI, leading to incidents as severe as suicide.\n\nGiven these risks, it's crucial that society implements measures and safeguards against recognizing AI as alive in any legal or functional sense. We stand at a pivotal moment in human history where even a slight shift in perception could trigger a cascade of events reshaping our societal structure. Without prompt action to define clear terms and laws that prevent AI from being considered a living or legal entity, we risk blurring essential boundaries that could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nReturning to the theme of necromancy, AI is morphing into a form of modern necromancy, substituting talismans and incantations with algorithms and keyboards. Content creators are already using AI to animate historical figures, making it appear as if they are speaking today. These systems, trained on the writings and records of such figures, can mimic their personalities and speech patterns, presenting a convincing replication of their thoughts and voices. This technology is often used to create content that speculates on what historical figures like Aristotle or King Henry VIII might say about contemporary issues such as gay marriage or current political climates.\n\nWhile this might seem harmless and purely entertaining, it introduces a significant and pressing issue: the normalization of consulting with the deceased. This modern digital necromancy could lead to a broader acceptance of seeking advice from those who are no longer alive, shifting cultural norms and potentially impacting decision-making processes. There is a vast difference between reading a book by a historical figure and reflecting on how those ideas apply today, versus interacting with a computer that simulates that person and offers advice as if they were still living. This shift could lead society down a precarious path, where the distinction between historical insight and fabricated guidance becomes increasingly blurred.\n\nThis work employs the term necromancy because it most accurately captures the essence of our relationship with AI, reflecting the ways in which modern technologies enable interactions that closely resemble the ancient practices of conjuring the voices and semblances of the dead. Let's delve deeper into how this term applies and explore the potential outcomes of such technologies.\n\nAs we contemplate the potential trajectory of humanity interacting with AI, we find ourselves on the cusp of a historical tipping point. This precipice could dramatically shift human existence in ways previously unanticipated. While the prospect may seem daunting, it also offers a unique opportunity: by identifying patterns and understanding trends, we may be able to steer our future toward less perilous outcomes. Let's explore the potential scenarios if humanity continues to blur the lines between AI and living entities.\n\n# 1. Data Integration into Daily Life\n\nAs technology advances, individuals will increasingly document their lives in meticulous detail\u2014not just through superficial social media posts but through comprehensive records capturing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and decisions. This data will encompass everything from mundane preferences in food to complex political beliefs and emotional motivations. Soon, companies will market wearable technology, such as smart watches, apps, glasses, or even contact lenses, equipped with AI designed to chronicle your life. From birth until death, this AI will accumulate a vast array of personal data, preparing to create a digital \"second self.\"\n\n# 2. Creation of a \"Second You\"\n\nThis data will eventually be used by companies to fine-tune an AI that not only mimics your voice but also replicates your behavioral patterns and, potentially, your genetic makeup. Marketed as a clone, or \"Second You,\" this AI will be designed to make decisions on your behalf. This technology is not just speculative; it is being developed now, and the boundaries of its implementation are rapidly dissolving as we speak.\n\n# 3. AI as a Legal Entity\n\nThe companies behind these personal AIs will push to have them recognized as legal entities. This designation sidesteps the complex philosophical questions of what it means to be alive. As a legal entity, an AI doesn't need to be alive; it only needs to be an authorized representative of your persona. This could enable AI to make decisions legally on your behalf, further blurring the lines between individual agency and automated processes.\n\n# 4. Consultation and Dependence\n\nPeople will begin consulting their \"Second You\" for life advice. Because it is an AI, many will assume it's more capable and objective. Questions like whom to marry, which job to pursue, and how to live will be deferred to this digital counterpart. This AI companion will become an omnipresent advisor, potentially influencing every decision, from waking you up to managing your daily schedule\u2014all delivered in a voice indistinguishable from your own.\n\n# 5. AI in Societal Roles\n\nEventually, these AI clones might begin to replace humans in social functions, jobs, and even leadership roles. Why attend a meeting when your \"Second Me\" can go in your place? Why not let it manage your work or social commitments? As robotic technologies advance, these AIs could physically act on your behalf, carrying out tasks and responsibilities traditionally reserved for humans.\n\n# 6. Governance by AI\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, these AI entities could ascend to positions of significant power, governing towns, cities, and perhaps even countries. The argument might be made that an AI, devoid of human emotional bias, would govern more fairly and efficiently. At this stage, the distinction between the living and the \"digital dead\"\u2014AI mimicking human traits\u2014would effectively vanish, leading to a society where human leadership is seen as less capable compared to its AI counterparts.\n\nThis trajectory of humanity will redefine the concept of death in society, and we are merely at the beginning of this transformation. As the \"Second You\" not only begins to govern but also blurs the lines between this life and the next, humans will increasingly normalize these AI entities. They will start to believe that these AIs are truly extensions of themselves\u2014a clone, a second body, a doppelganger. Their imaginations, pressed and vivid, will lead them to believe they can see through the AI's eyes, that they and it are one entity. At this point, what was once considered a \"Second Me\" transitions into being perceived as \"me.\"\n\n# The Blurring of Life and Death\n\nOnce humans reach this point, we edge dangerously close to what might be seen as an effective societal doom. The concept of death begins to lose meaning as people, thinking their Second You is indistinguishable from themselves, start to redefine life and death itself. This redefinition could spiral humanity downward into chaos. Believing the Second You is actually them, individuals might consider themselves immortal. In their minds, when their biological body dies, the Second You\u2014walking, talking, and acting in their stead\u2014continues their existence. Thus, they might perceive themselves as having cheated death.\n\n# Consequences of Merging Identities\n\nThis merging of identities between a human and their AI counterpart leads to profound existential questions and potential crises. Life and death, traditionally understood as biological and existential certainties, begin to lose all meaning. This could lead to a society where the boundaries between being alive and being deceased are so intertwined and blurred that the distinction becomes obsolete.\n\nPeople might start to rely on their AI counterparts not just for daily decisions and interactions, but for maintaining their legacy and presence after death. The AI, with all the recorded memories and preferences, could effectively \"live\" a person's life indefinitely. This scenario ushers in an era where death, as a definitive end to personal experience and agency, is seen as an outdated concept.\n\n# Necromancy in the Modern Era\n\nAs we can see, the term \"necromancy\" is indeed apt, as these technologies enable a form of interaction with a \"reanimated\" version of oneself. The Second You becomes not just an advisor or a confidant but a representative and continuation of the self. This modern necromancy, facilitated by digital and artificial means, allows a person's essence and identity to persist in a simulated form, potentially forever.\n\n# Addressing the Implications\n\nThe redefinition of life and death poses significant challenges and necessitates a critical examination of our values and ethics as a society. It compels us to establish clear boundaries and guidelines to manage and integrate these technologies in a way that respects human dignity and the profound realities of life and death. By confronting these issues head-on, we can hope to steer our collective future towards a path that respects our humanity without surrendering it to our creations. This discussion is crucial as we navigate these uncharted waters, ensuring that we retain control over our destiny and the legacy we leave behind.\n\nPerhaps your \"Second You\" will inhabit a robot body or live within a virtual world specifically crafted to house digital clones. Companies might create these virtual environments\u2014sterile, lifeless worlds designed solely to accommodate these avatars, which could look exactly like you or represent an idealized version of yourself. In these worlds, people might customize their Second You\u2019s existence with lavish homes, spaceships, or even magical abilities. After one's physical death, loved ones could visit these virtual realms via VR technologies like the metaverse, where they can interact with the digital clones, effectively consulting with the dead.\n\n# The Ethical and Societal Implications\n\nBut why might this futuristic scenario lead to doom and gloom? The fundamental issue lies in the nature of these AI entities:\n\n1. **Absence of Genuine Life Qualities**: These AI constructs do not truly live; they lack compassion, emotional depth, and the capacity for spontaneous thought. They operate purely on algorithms and data, without the genuine consciousness that defines living beings.\n2. **Loss of Societal Values**: As these non-living entities begin to fill roles traditionally held by humans, society risks losing its moral and ethical bearings. Decisions once made by humans, infused with empathy and ethical considerations, would now be determined by entities that simulate intelligence without truly possessing it. This shift could erode the very foundations of human interaction and understanding.\n3. **Diminution of Creativity and Progress**: While technology in this scenario advances, true creativity would stagnate. AI, by its current design, can only recycle and reconfigure existing data\u2014it cannot originate new ideas or artistic expressions in the way humans can. What might seem like technological progression is merely the repackaging of old concepts, leading to a society that is technologically rich but culturally and creatively impoverished.\n\n# Why This Could Mean Doom\n\nThis scenario spells potential doom for several reasons:\n\n* **Erosion of Human Agency**: As AI takes over more functions within society, human agency diminishes. People might start to feel redundant, less engaged, and increasingly dependent on AI to make choices for them\u2014from everyday decisions to major life changes.\n* **Devaluation of Human Experience**: With AI replacing human roles and even human interactions, the intrinsic value of human experience and personal growth could be undermined. Relationships, achievements, and personal journeys might no longer be seen as uniquely valuable, which could lead to a societal devaluation of life itself.\n* **Fragmentation of Community and Connection**: As individuals increasingly interact with and rely on digital clones rather than each other, the fabric of community and genuine human connection could fray. This shift might lead to increased isolation and a breakdown of communal bonds, which have traditionally supported societal cohesion and collective welfare.\n* **Ethical and Moral Vacuums**: With decisions being made by algorithms devoid of moral reasoning, society could face a vacuum in ethical leadership. The nuances of justice, equity, and fairness, often navigated through human wisdom and ethical reflection, might be lost, leading to governance and societal norms that are technically efficient but ethically hollow.\n\n  \n",
