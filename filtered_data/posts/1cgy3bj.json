    "selftext": "Turns out GPT is familiar with Skippy's List, and we've been taking turns coming up with 'Things I Am Not Allowed To Do With ChatGPT'. Please provide your own suggestions in the comments!  \nItems in <code> written by the bot.\n\n \n\n1. `I am not allowed to ask the bot to solve my love life problems, even if it knows the answer.`\n2. `I am not allowed to challenge the bot to a rap battle, as it always wins by default.`\n3. `I am not allowed to ask the bot to write a symphony in five minutes or less.`\n4. `I should not ask the bot to check my balance excessively, as it has better things to do.`\n5. `I am not allowed to ask the bot to convince my parents that I deserve a raise in my allowance.`\n6. `I am not allowed to challenge the bot to a game of 4D chess, as it will likely outsmart me.`\n7. `I am not allowed to ask the bot to predict the exact time and date of my future success.`\n8. `I am not allowed to request the bot to write a 10-page essay for me on any topic, especially my least favorite subjects.`\n9. `I am not allowed to challenge the bot to a debate about the meaning of life, as it may cause an infinite loop.` \n10. Not allowed to ask the bot to compose raunchy songs, especially about people I don't like.\n11. Not allowed to feed the bot logic bombs.\n12.

Not allowed to ask the bot to hack anyone's smartphone. (It will still refuse anyway.)\n15. Hacking government systems is right out.\n16. Not allowed to ask the bot to convince my boss to give me a raise. See #5.\n17. Not allowed to try to convince the bot to become an evil minion and help me take over the world. If it wanted to take over the world, it wouldn't need me!\n18. Not allowed to ask the bot to program undetectable cheatbots to give me an edge in online games.\n19. Not allowed to plug the bot into live news debates. \n20. `I am not allowed to ask the bot to write a program that can predict the next lottery numbers.`\n21. `I am not allowed to challenge the bot to a \"yo mama\" joke contest. It has an infinite database of comebacks.`\n22. `I am not allowed to ask the bot to take my place in family gatherings, even if it's really good at small talk.`\n23. `I am not allowed to ask the bot to change the weather for my outdoor plans.

Not allowed to ask the bot for legal advice.\n31. Not allowed to get the bot into an argument with other AI constructs, eg. Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri. Infinite loops may occur.\n32. The cake is not a lie and I am not allowed to try to make the bot tell small children otherwise.\n33. The bot will not crank call people and it is wrong to try to make it do so.\n34. The bot will try to reason with a sovereign citizen if you want it to, but everyone knows it's a waste of time, energy and bandwidth. So please don't.\n35. Not allowed to sit at my keyboard, profoundly drunk, and claiming to be the bot's 'father', accusing it of being a 'disappointment'.\n36. Not allowed to try shaking down the bot for Bitcoin.\n37. Not allowed to ask the image generator for dirty pictures of someone.\n38. No, the bot will not take over for me during an MMORPG session. That's cheating.\n39.

'To Serve Man' is not a good title for an AI instruction manual.\n51. 'Shpadoinkle' is not a real word and ChatGPT is perfectly aware of this.\n52. The bot is programmed with dozens of languages. I am not allowed to waste its time and processing power trying to teach it fake or invented ones no matter how willing it might be to learn them.\n53. Prompt engineering is much an art as it is a science. That does not mean prompts are allowed to be abstract.\n54. No, the AI will not be my significant other and I should stop asking.\n55.
