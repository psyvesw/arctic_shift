    "selftext": "Hiya,\n\nI am an Australian university student. I am in my third (final) year of my Bachelor's degree. Last year I was falsely accused of using AI in my assessment by Turnitin. I was referred to my school's integrity officer and they agreed with me that it was a false positive. Stupidly enough, what the detector claimed was AI detection was literally just statistics that I had used from the internet and some basic information about the theory used in the paper that was referenced. I wish I was joking... I later found out that it isn't just me. Lots of students in my school within the uni have been falsely accused.\n\n I was recently accused again, about two weeks ago. Again, I provided my evidence to my lecturer as this time he didn't refer it to the integrity officer. I was cleared again. I found out several other students in the same course were also accused of using AI. A lot of them are obviously too ashamed to speak out. I wasn't surprised that this happened again tbh. If it happened once, it is going to happen again. There is something about my writing that Turnitin is flagging as AI generated but I don't know what. I don't use AI for my assessments.  As a precautionary measure, I put all of my assessments through GPTZero to check the likelihood of my work being flagged for AI usage. I also put some of this lecturer's work through GPTZero and it came up 20% likelihood of AI detection. This time, I was unable to see what Turnitin was claiming as AI generated. This similarity score is hidden from us and we are only able to access it if the university gives us access. I was only given access to this on the first instance of false detection  because it got referred to the integrity officer.  \n\n\nI'm really concerned about getting flaged again for AI usage. I'm too scared to talk to my university about this. I'm in my last year and I just want to be able to graduate in peace. I'm looking for options for what to do. I am on my school's board so I could bring it up to them but it is such a sensitive topic. The lecturers don't seem to understand how turnitin can't actually detect AI usage. I could also talk to the student union about this but I have a feeling they really just represent the interests of the university, not the students themselves.",
