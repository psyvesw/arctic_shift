    "selftext": "This year my property tax appraisal was  35.11% higher than last  years appraisal, and I've made literally no improvements to my home or property.  \n\nI went to ChatGPT looking for a way to convince my local appraisal district board that it would be simpler to lower my appraisal than fight with me about it.\n\nMy initial prompt was:\n\n\"what is the most difficult to answer question that can be asked of an appraisal district.  one that will more likely cause them to lower my property value\"\n\n*ChatGPT's response was:  \"Can you provide a detailed justification and supporting documentation for the assessed value of my property, including how it compares to similar properties in the neighborhood with equivalent features, size, and condition, and explain any discrepancies?\"*\n\nMy follow up prompt was:  \"please make this  in a letter format and make it much more serious.\n\nChatGPT's response was:\n\n  \n*Subject: Request for Detailed Justification and Documentation of Property Value Assessment*\n\n*I am writing to formally request a detailed justification and supporting documentation for the assessed value of my property located at \\[Your Property Address\\]. As a property owner and taxpayer, I seek to understand the basis of the valuation and ensure its accuracy and fairness.*\n\n*Specifically, I would like to request the following:*\n\n1. *A comprehensive explanation of how the assessed value of my property was determined, including a comparison with similar properties in the neighborhood that have equivalent features, size, and condition. Please provide detailed information on any discrepancies observed.*\n2. *The specific formula or equations used in the valuation process. Understanding the mathematical basis of the assessment is crucial for me.*\n3. *Any relevant factors or variables that were considered in the calculation of my property\u2019s value. This includes but is not limited to physical characteristics, location, market trends, and any other pertinent factors.*\n4. *The data sources utilized in the assessment process and how these sources are applied to determine the property value. This should include information on the reliability and recency of the data.*\n5. *Any adjustments or considerations that were uniquely applied to my property. If there were particular factors or adjustments made that differ from the standard assessment process, please provide detailed explanations.*\n\n*By providing this information, you can help me better understand the valuation process and ensure that the assessment of my property is both accurate and equitable. If there are any forms or additional steps required to process this request, please let me know.*\n\n*I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your prompt response.*\n\n*Thank you for your time and cooperation.*\n\n  \nThe letter did the trick!  I emailed it to my county appraisal board.  I just got off the phone with them, and my property value was only increased by 3.05%...and I set that price!\n\nI can honestly say my ChatGPT subscription paid for itself by several thousand percent.\n\n",
