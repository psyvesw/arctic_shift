    "selftext": "My last two discussion posts were flagged as 100% AI and I had a discussion with her about it and she still giving me a zero for it. They are not AI but I\u2019m stuck because I can\u2019t technically prove it wasn\u2019t. She ran it through ChatGPT and those were the results it gave her. It\u2019s a gen Ed history class at a community college and it\u2019s not my favorite subject to be honest. I try my best, of course but it\u2019s not like I regularly make a point of holding onto the knowledge for extended periods of time. The only type of outside help I get is just asking questions from other friends that who are history buffs but once I read the chapters and answer the discussion questions I usually don\u2019t think about it again. She tried to, ask me about it and I was kind of stuck because it\u2019s not like my adhd brain could accurately remember. I asked her to look at my previous discussion post and she would see that my formatting in my writing style look very similar. She said she didn\u2019t want to do that because if she put it in and it also showed 100% then she would have to give me a zero for those as well. It\u2019s absolutely tanked my grade and I don\u2019t know what to do. If I do well in the final slides project, I still have a shot at passing the class, but it\u2019s just very disheartening. Any advice is appreciated. \n\nNote* I know what some of you are going to say and unfortunately I didn\u2019t do it in a word document or anything like that because I was just answering a discussion post so usually I would just type directly into the discussion post while I was reading the chapter or sometimes I would do it on my Notes app on my iPad at work. So it\u2019s not like I can go into my version history and prove it. It\u2019s supposed to be just a discussion, so I wasn\u2019t looking to make it into like an MLA format or anything like that so I didn\u2019t see the need to do it in like a doc*",
