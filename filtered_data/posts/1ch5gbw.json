    "selftext": "I'm in a space (comics) where people are pretty anti-ai, but its gotten to the point where I feel like I at least got to give it a fair shot. I want to really make the most of ai, see what it can offer me. I purchased chat gpt pro, but honestly do not have many ideas for what to use it for. And I feel like I'm not giving it a fair shot If I am not exploring all it can offer.\n\nMy ideas so far:\n\n* music recommendations?\n* Research is the big one. I like to make fantasty maps, but don't super understand geography. I could give it my ideas, and it could give me geographic knowledge on how that would work or what it would have to look like, as well resources to double check?\n* Also research on history, like if I need examples on how various cultures did something I could ask it.\n* I usually do all my math through wolfram alpha, but there are times when I don't know how to express something as a formula, only through plain language. Maybe chatgtp could be helpful there.\n* Nutrition maybe? I've been having trouble coming up with meal plans to lower blood sugar.\n\naaaaaaaaaaaand thats it. I have no idea how to use this thing. Any suggestions? What do you use chatgpt for?\n\nAlso two additional questions, do I just use chatgpt 4 for this or are other more specialized gpts better? Also is it public who is using chat gpt (considering my field of work, being known as being someone who has used chat gpt even for things other than work could be pretty bad right now)?\n\nThank you! I would appreciate any advice you have!",
