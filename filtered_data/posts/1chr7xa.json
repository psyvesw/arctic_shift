    "selftext": "I'm an author who uses ChatGPT as a brainstorming and research tool, along with helping me create marketing content. I recently upgraded to v4 again after not seeing the benefit last year. \n\nOne thing I am struggling with is how much copy it can consume from a document I upload. In the past, it seems to have been able to consume a whole manuscript, and even wrote a detailed summary of my writing style. There's used to be a tool that allowed you to upload documents but it now seems to be integrated.\n\nWhen I ask what it is capable of consuming, the response is:\n\n\"My ability to process text is limited to smaller chunks at a time, typically around 1000-1500 words.\"\n\nWhich seems like an awfully small amount for an AI to consume. In the past, I have manually pasted chunks of text that were easily over that number and it never complained. \n\nCan anyone definitively state what the actual limit is? Is there a way to get ChatGPT to consume a large document and analyze it? (For example, to write a basic synopsis I could work from.)\n\nI don't know if there are additional \"plug ins\" or other ways to approach this other than the main interface. But a 1500 word limit seems odd considering what the whole system is continually digesting. \n\nIt also gets confused about retaining information across sessions. On one hand it states:\n\n\"However, I don't retain information from previous interactions across  sessions, so I can't synthesize insights across multiple chapters from  different sessions into a cohesive understanding of the entire  manuscript.\"\n\nThen it says:\n\n\"Yes, I can retain information across our conversations now if that's something you find useful.\"\n\nIt's frustrating trying to get good results when it seems like the goal posts keep moving. Any tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;",
