    "selftext": "I only have used chatgpt - downloaded app and tried the + version for a month. Looking at the App Store there\u2019s tons of options and I\u2019m confused. I hear about Claude as well. \n\nWhat\u2019s a chatbot? An assistant? The App Store has these in the title or description and there are so many that say chatgpt, does that mean they use that machine, or system, of data or learning to output answers? Is it apt to use a comparison, as in Spanish and French is to language as chatgpt and Claude is to ai? \n\nI did see a review about chatgpt and it was saying that it is kind of too empty in a way that Claude isn\u2019t. It was my experience with chatgpt. Like I was looking for criticism and help and it just seemed to be mostly encouraging, I had to really ask it to be critical, but it felt like pageant answers mostly repeating what I said and encouraging more and rephrasing what I already said in detail and exhaustively. \n\nAlso I had heard an issue, which I tried and came up with the same result. If you say you have a cup that is a cylinder and close on one end and open on the other and put a pen cap inside of it and place the cup upside down on the floor with the pen cap under and pick it up and turn the cup over, where is the pen cap. It will repeatedly answer that the cap is in the cup. \n\nAnyway, I want to learn more and I\u2019m trying to distinguish between categories of ai apps. If there are any good links to understand the basics, send them my way. Thank you! ",
