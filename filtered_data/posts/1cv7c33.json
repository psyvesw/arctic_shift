    "selftext": "Hello,\u00a0Idris\u00a0here from [indieniche](https://indieniche.substack.com/). This week I want to share a summarised version of my interview with Daniel Nguyen, A \u00a0Product Engineer generating $10k/month building AI apps\n\n[You can find the full case study here](https://open.substack.com/pub/indieniche/p/product-engineer-generating-10kmonth?r=3q3p07&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)\n\n\n##Q: Hello! Who are you and what product are you working on currently?\nI'm Daniel Nguyen. I'm an entrepreneur based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I've been building multiple products: [KTool](https://ktool.io/),\u00a0[BoltAI](https://boltai.com/),\u00a0[PDF Pals](https://pdfpals.com/)\n\n##Q: What is your backstory and how did you come up with your idea?\u00a0 Do you have any partners?\n\nI've been a product engineer for more than 12 years. Then one day, I discovered Indie Hacking and found it fascinating. I quit my cushy job to start building in public. \n\nI decided to learn more about generative AI & OpenAI API and hopefully find a good freelance gig. I did land a couple of interesting gigs, but what is more interesting is I found a new product idea: BoltAI - a better way to use OpenAI & other AI services on macOS. I started it purely to learn more about SwiftUI development & OpenAI app development (the so-called \"AI wrapper\"). It's now my top revenue-generating product.\n\nWhile building BoltAI, one customer asked about the ability to chat with PDF natively on Mac (another \"AI wrapper\" idea). I found it interesting and so I decided to build it. PDF Pals recently reached 700 paid customers (about 23% of my total revenue in 2023)\nAnd finally, I built ShotSolve as a lead magnet for BoltAI (engineering as marketing, or side project marketing). It was welcomed by many Mac users and so far, has brought 1500 visitors to BoltAI.\n\n\n##Q: Take us through the process of building the first version of your product MVP. \n\nWhen I started, I didn\u2019t expect BoltAI to be commercially viable. It comes from my pet peeve of switching back and forth between ChatGPT web UI and native Mac apps like Xcode or Apple Notes.\nUnlike VSCode, there is no Copilot for XCode and I have the habit of writing blog posts in Apple Notes so I figured I need a tool to invoke ChatGPT right within these apps.\u00a0So I decided to build the MVP in a weekend. The app was ugly but I managed to ship it anyway.\u00a0\n\n\n##Q: How did you get your first customers for your product (Free or paid users)\n\nI tweeted about it, and posted it to multiple communities asking for feedback: IndieHacker, Reddit, WIP\u2026\nIt went semi-viral and early adopters started to use the app. I got valuable feedback and improved the product accordingly. Some of them converted to paid customers.\n\n\n##Q: Since you launched your product, What has worked to attract customers\n\nDoubling down on what works mostly. That's social media (X/Reddit), email newsletters, and paid ads.\n\n\n##Q: How is your product performing currently, and what are your plans for the future? Can you share your current metrics and revenue figures?\n\nBoltAI is doing great. I plan to support business customers better, and will kind of \"pivot\" into B2B. Currently, most customers of BoltAI are prosumers: freelancers, developers, or content writers. I believe it would be much better if I could sell directly to businesses.\n\n[Read the full\u00a0case study here](https://open.substack.com/pub/indieniche/p/product-engineer-generating-10kmonth?r=3q3p07&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)\n\n\n\nWe put several hours into this research and it covers mostly all aspects:\n\n* How he got his ideas to build his AI apps \n* How he built his first MVP \n* Tools that have helped him grow his products \n* Books and podcasts that have been impactful to him \n* Advice for other founders starting out to build their apps \n\nThis story inspired me a lot, I love growth and building profitable businesses, so I hope you will feel the same energy from it!\nIf you find this a lot useful , [Let\u2019s connect together](https://indieniche.substack.com/)to read more when I interview founders like this \n",
