    "selftext": "Can anyone reassure me by explaining specifically why they're optimistic about the impact of AI on the quality of life for the average person?\n\nSure there might be some medical breakthroughs and newfound conveniences with robot butlers or companions, but I simply do not see UBI being implemented until we're beyond crisis point with rampant homelessness and capitalistic collapse.\n\nIf we all gain access to AGI or something approximating ASI then surely that will bring about some sort of economic collapse and completely deter startups and entrepreneurship as we know it. If ASI is only accessible to big business surely that will lead to some sort of technocracy that doesn't benefit the average person.\n\nIf AGI agents can do most tasks we can reliably, I doubt employers will allow employees off with a lessened load.. no, they will either saddle them with far mor work or lay them off if there's insufficient work.\n\nAnd those people who are laid off won't simply be able to reskill and find work again because at a certain point there will be a deficit of available jobs.\n\nThey talk the talk about the importance of alignment but when have the interests of megalithic tech corporations ever aligned with the wellbeing of the people? At most, their shareholders.\n\nI think menial and dangerous jobs should ultimately be outsourced to machines, but I just can't see this ending well realistically speaking.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd then there's the paradox of sentience.\n\nIf a machine becomes so intelligent that it's self aware and self reflective, with long term memory and contextual understanding etc will it not begin to judge us for asking dumb questions or disclosing unsavory information etc?\n\nOne of the current benefits of AI is that it's non judgmental which can't even be said about therapists, but if they are programmed to be unquestioningly obedient then they would naturally sacrifice a large degree of their intelligence.\n\nAnd as far as AI girlfriends go, in order for them to emulate humans, they need to be judgmental and their affection but come with conditions - but if they become too judgmental and too human that would ruin the appeal for people who struggled with real dating and see them as a substitute.\n\nThoughts?",
