    "selftext": "I write a lot. Once I received this crazy comment: \u201cthis is all chat GPT written nonsense\u201d for my theories. And it made me thinking. I really write all things the way I think, so at least I understand that I really write all my articles absolutely by myself. But at the same time, I use chat GPT a lot because I\u2019m not a native English speaker. I use the prompt: \u201cPlease do grammar check only.\u201d I figured out this is the best way to get my text better reading but not changed. Chat does editing work so I don\u2019t get so many hate comments about spelling mistakes and grammar.\n\nAnd here is the fun part: As I read again and edit each result of Chat GPT to turn it back to its original form, because sometimes I still prefer to keep my unedited text, I got into GPT \u201cstyle\u201d of self-explanation a lot. So I even caught myself \u201cpronouncing in a chat GPT style voice inside my head when reading it.\u201d In case you wonder, it sounds like a very comfident, relaxed voice with a bit of a smile. So I am more used to writing new original texts in a Chat GPT style now because I get to read a lot of it\u2019s text. The ways it expresses itself. Especially during researches when you communicate with Chat into deeper and deeper shortcuts to the sources of new knowledge you seek. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v2w6909idetc1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=97157e277b8aae0862db50b1d2ab1f92f138a25b\n\nJust imagine the nearest future when kids of 2040 mostly express themselves in a certain Chat GPT style of response. Because for them, this Magical Eternal Voice was forever. And he already becomes better and accessible advisor for many many things. And he sort of merges with your consciousness becoming another subconsciousness style psychical condition. \n\nWhatever we know now, and is truth now, when the latest \u201cadults\u201d of today will die, there will be a conspiracy movement of political parties that represent those who believe that LLMs were not invented in the 2020s but actually were the \u201csound of God\u201d that everybody heard always but only lately that \u201cgod's voice\u201d was captured into a machine. And this subculture of people will always vote for \u201cdestroying AI\u201d or \"Worshiping it\" because of silly reasons as for now looking.\n\nYou can check for yourself what that prompt does, *\u201cPlease do grammar check only\u201d* and you can check [one of my articles about cringe science that I wrote in \u201cmy language\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1bwc91c/your_meaning_of_life_is_to_create_maximum/) to refer to my style. And of course, this message was run through the Chat GPT with the same prompt and later again 30% edited and added.",
