    "selftext": "Recently, OpenAI released ChatGPT 4o, a new version of their popular language model. This update brings some exciting features along withit\u2019s capability to analyze video and images realtime. Here is a shortened version of the use cases of ChatGPT 4o.\n\n\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1csi7eb/video/ap0tsjs3pk0d1/player\n\n\n\n**1. Visual Analysis and Insights:**\n\nThe main feature of ChatGPT 4o is it goes beyond just language. It can analyze images and video and provide real-time insights. Share an image during a conversation, and the AI will describe its contents, identify objects, and offer relevant information. In the demo you can see it guiding a visually impaired person realtime. Although it\u2019s just a demo (made me remember devin) but this feature is very exciting and promising.\n\n\n\n**2. Realtime Translation:**\n\nCommunication across languages is a challenge while using AIs. While these AIs can communicate and response with excellent English but same can\u2019t be said for other lesser used Languages in the web. It\u2019s expected as the web is primarily English. ChatGPT 4o solves this by offering real-time translation capabilities. You can now have conversations with people who speak different languages, with the AI seamlessly translating the conversation for smooth and efficient interaction. This is particularly helpful for international business, academic collaborations or me who often translates social media posts to English.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**3. Meeting Assistant:**\n\nMeetings often feel unproductive and time-consuming. According to OpenAI, ChatGPT 4o can change that by acting as a virtual meeting assistant. It can help organize agendas, take notes, and summarize key points while the meeting is happening. Additionally, it can suggest action items, follow-ups, and next steps, ensuring meetings are focused and productive for all participants. All these are from demos, I did not use the AI for this purpose yet so I cannot bouch here.\n\n\n\n**4. 3D Objects:**\n\nAs I mentioned before, ChatGPT 4o's impressive skillset extends to vision and 3D analysis. It offers the capability of 3D object synthesis, allowing users to generate and manipulate three-dimensional models. Through textual descriptions or prompts, users can instruct ChatGPT 4o to create detailed 3D objects. In a demo OpenAI\u2019s logo was created with the company name as a 3D object by a simple prompt.\n\n\n\n**5. Explain Complex Topics:**\n\nChatGPT 4o can act as a real-time tutor, engaging in conversations to explain complex topics. OpenAI released a video demo where the AI is teaching math realtime. It can solve math problems and explain how to approach a problem. It can break down concepts step-by-step, offer personalized guidance, and provide immediate feedback on your work. I am not confident that it can solve much complex problems but the demos are promising.\n\nWhat do you think of these features? For me personally, it\u2019s a step forward from just textual LLM models. I\u2019ve wrote indetails of the new ChatGPT 4o in my newsletter.
