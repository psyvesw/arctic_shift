    "selftext": "So far, I've used Copilot since it's free and comes with Chat-GPT 4 for getting some help with questions, like asking why something is done a certain way, asking for feedback on my resume or essays to improve them, or try to figure out how to do the question. The problem is it isn't great at it, since it gets stuff wrong a lot of isn't good at working step by step through a problem with you. \n\nI've also tried a site called [studyx.ai](https://studyx.ai), or StudyX, that gives you access to all of the models like GPT 4o, etc., to get answers, custom set up, step by step with the solution and some access to community answers or ask \"experts\" for answers. It also gets stuff wrong a lot and if you want to chat with the AI, get it to act like a tutor rather than writing out every step to solve the problem, it takes five times as many credits to chat with it as a tutor, so it doesn't help me understand problems since it gives solutions that are only sometimes right. It's also like $15 a month for 10,000 credits a month, for a whole year, so I have like it's a ripoff.\n\nIs it worth subscribing to something like ChatGPT Plus and use custom GPTs like Khanmigo Light, Chemistry tutor one, or some of the others to get help, or just ask Chat GPT 4 or GPT 4-o since you get 80 messages every 3 hours plus 20 messages for GPT 4 Turbo?\n\nWhat about Khanmigo from Khan Academy, has anyone used it? Google Gemini advanced for $20 a month or the subscription for Claude? Finally, what about Poe, is that worth it?\n\nFinally, are their better resources that I should use or any other advice? Thanks!",
