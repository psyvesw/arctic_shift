    "selftext": "Chat GPT was already very good, but it was admittedly getting predictable after a while, tending to write stories in the same sort of obvious way and often missing details, resulting in stories that were impressive, but rarely completely satisfying, and always ending on a \"and then everything turned out alright and everyone was happy\". It meant you had to add a lot of detail to the prompt to get it to actually put effort in.\n\n4.0 in my opinion is a big improvement. It really tries harder to vary how it writes stories. I gave it the prompt \"Write a story about Gilderoy Lockhart attempting to learn the spell Peskipiksi Pesternomi.\" and it was genuinely really stunning how it immediately learned the character's smarmy personality, how it had the character reference his \"achievements\", while mentioning that those \"achievements\" were falsified, and even writing it in the style of the books. It didn't go down the predictable la-di-da route where \"Oh, first it was hard, then he got better.\" No, it actually learned, instantly, that Peskipiksi Pesternomi is a non-existent spell, one he invented in desperation that of course failed. So, throughout most of the story GPT generated, it repeatedly fails, only working on the very last attempt, and even then, only a little.\n\nSo yeah, GPT 4.0 is noticeably better to me. Really, really cool to watch your ideas come magically to life with a simple prompt, and now it's trying even harder to do more with what you give it.",
