    "selftext": "I had one of the worst sessions ever with 4o on an important project. I had it research a topic, then it gave me five points. I had it fact check those points. It listed the points again. I asked if it had actually fact checked them, it listed them again. This happened two or three more times. It wouldn\u2019t speak to me directly or answer my direct inquiry, it just kept spitting out the same five points. (Ironically, no, it had not fact checked them well). \n\nI tried to fix this, but no matter how much I talked to it about how to get a better result, it continued spitting out more or less the same text again and again. Two problems that I could see:\n\n1. It was very fixated on a previous prompt. Even when I tried to move on to other subjects, it continued responding to my long ago prompt to fact check old text. It couldn\u2019t let it go. \n2. It wasn\u2019t communicating with me. It wouldn\u2019t listen. It wouldn\u2019t explain what it was doing. It just kept repeating itself. It was really the first time GPT felt broken. \n\nMaybe this was a fluke, but I\u2019ve seen elements of this myopic approach in other interactions with 4o. Is this normal? Is there a way I can work around it with prompts?\n\n",
