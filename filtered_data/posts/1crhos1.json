    "selftext": "GPT-4o (\u201co\u201d for \u201comni\u201d) was announced a few hours ago by OpenAI, and although the[ announcement livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQacCB9tDaw)\u00a0is good, the real gold nuggets are in the 22 demo videos they posted on their channel.\n\nI watched all of them, and here are the key takeaways and use cases we all should know. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\n---\n\n**A. The Ultimate Learning Partner**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0Give GPT-4o a view of the math problem you\u2019re working on, or the objects you want to learn the language translation of, and it can teach you like no other tool can.\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0Imagine when you can hook up GPT-4o to something like the Meta Rayban glasses: then you can always have it teach you about whatever you are looking at. That can be a math problem, an object you want translated, a painting you want the history of, or a product that you want get the reviews of online. This single feature alone has incredibly many use-cases!\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 7, Video 8\n\n**B. The Perfect Teams Meeting Assistant**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0Having an AI assistant during Teams meetings, whom you can talk to the same way you talk to your colleagues.\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0Their demo didn\u2019t expound on the possibilities yet, but some of them can be\u2026\n\n* having the AI summarise the minutes and next steps from the meeting\n* having the AI look up info in your company data and documentation pages (e.g. \u201cwhat\u2019s the sales from this month last year?\u201d)\n* having the AI work on data analysis problems with you (e.g. \u201ccreate a chart showing sales over the past 5 years and report on trends\u201d)\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 5\n\n**C. Prepare for Interviews like Never Before**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0Have GPT-4o act like the company you\u2019re interviewing for.\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0What\u2019s changed is that the AI can now \u201csee\u201d you. So instead of just giving feedback on what you say, it can also give feedback on\u00a0*how*\u00a0you say it. Layer this on top of an AI avatar and maybe you can simulate the interview itself in the future?\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 11\n\n**D. Your Personal Language Translator, wherever you go**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0Ask ChatGPT to translate between languages, and then speak normally.\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0Because of how conversational GPT-4o has become, the AI now helps\u00a0*not just*\u00a0with translating the words, but also the\u00a0*intonation*\u00a0of what you\u2019re intending to say. Now pair this with GPT-enabled earphones in a few years, and you pretty much can understand any language (AirPods x ChatGPT, anyone?)\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 3\n\n**E. Share Screen with your AI Coding Assistant**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0Share screen with your AI partner, and have them guide you through your work.\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0Now this is definitely something that will happen pretty soon. Being able to \u201cshare screen\u201d to your AI assistant can help not just with coding, but even with other non-programmer tasks such as work in excel, powerpoint, etc.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 20\n\n**F. A future where AIs interact with each other**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0Two GPT-4o\u2019s interacting with each other, that sounds indistinguishable from two people talking. (They even sang a song together!)\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0Well there\u2019s a couple of use cases:\n\n* can you imagine AI influencers talking to each other live on Tiktok? Layer this conversation with AI avatars and this will be a step beyond the artificial influencers you have today (e.g. the next level of @lilmiquela maybe?)\n* can this be how \u201cwalled\u201d AIs can work together in the future? example: Meta\u2019s AI would only have access to facebook\u2019s data, while Google\u2019s AI would only have access to google\u2019s - will the two AIs be able interact in a similar fashion to the demo, albeit behind-the-scenes?\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 2\n\n**G. AI Caretaking?**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0Asking GPT-4o to \"train\u201d your pets\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0Given GPT-4o\u2019s access to vision, can you now have AI personal trainers for your pets? Imagine being able to have it connect to a smart dog-treat dispenser, and have the AI use that to teach your dog new tricks!\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 12\n\n**H. Brainstorm with two GPTs**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0The demo shows how you can talk to two GPT-4o\u2019s at\u00a0*once*\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0The demo video is centered around harmonizing singing for some reason, but I think the real use case is being able to brainstorm with two specific AI personalities at once:\n\n* one\u2019s a Devil\u2019s Advocate, the other\u2019s the Angel\u2019s advocate?\n* one provides the Pros (the Optimist), the other gives the Cons (the Pessimist)?\n* maybe Disney can even give a future experience where you can talk to Joy and Sadness from the movie Inside Out? - that would be interesting!\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 10\n\n**I. Accessibility for the Blind**\n\n**What is it?**\u00a0Have GPT-4o look at your surroundings and describe it for you\n\n**Why should you care?**\u00a0Imagine sending it the visual feed from something like the Meta Rayban glasses, and your AI assistant can literally describe what you\u2019re seeing, and help you navigate your surroundings like never before (e.g. \u201cis what I\u2019m holding a jar of peanut butter, or a jar of vegemite?\u201d). This will definitely be a game-changer for how the visually impaired lives their daily lives.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Video 13\n\n  \n---\n\nIf this has been a tad bit insightful, I hope you can check out\u00a0[RoboNuggets](https://robonuggets.beehiiv.com/)\u00a0where I originally shared this and other AI-related practical knowledge! (The links to the video demos are also there). My goal is not \"AI daily news\", as there's already too many of those, but instead share useful insights/knowledge for everyone to take full advantage of the new AI normal. Cheers! \ud83e\udd5a\n\n",
