    "selftext": "Wrote a letter for my father and asked AI to create different versions of it. It's surprisingly funny and impressive.\n\nVersion 1\n\nDear Father,\n\nIn the quiet moments of reflection, I find my heart brimming with gratitude for you. It's a feeling that transcends reason, encompassing every facet of my life. This letter, long overdue, is a small token of my appreciation for the myriad ways you've enriched my life.\n\nYour wisdom has been my guiding star, illuminating the unknown and equipping me with invaluable skills, both in life and within the walls of our family's medical shop. Your teachings on discerning right from wrong have been the foundation of my moral compass.\n\nAs I navigate the waters of adulthood at 21, your love remains my anchor\u2014pure, steadfast, and unconditional. My gratitude for your past and ongoing sacrifices knows no bounds.\n\nRecalling the day you felt overlooked, a pang of sorrow touched my soul. Through this letter, I wish to reassure you that I am, and always will be, a steadfast presence in your life. Loneliness shall not find you, for my ambition is to be a source of pride for you. I am committed to excelling in my studies, securing a promising career, and ensuring the well-being of both you and mom.\n\nYou are more than a father to me\u2014you are a remarkable teacher, a compassionate healer, and a wise mentor. I vow to stand by you and mom, proving through my deeds that I am a true extension of your legacy. You both hold an irreplaceable place in my heart. Though I may have come to understand the value of our bond later in life, I am now fully aware of its significance. If any words herein have caused you discomfort, I seek your forgiveness and guidance to better myself.\n\nWords fall short when trying to convey the depth of my feelings, but I promise to let my actions speak volumes. No amount of gratitude could ever suffice, yet I pledge to earn a name that brings you honor and to be the son you deserve.\n\nLet us leave the past behind and embark on a future filled with joy, care, love, and unwavering support. With heartfelt thanks\n\n",
