When she graded it a week later, she gave me a 0%. Horrified, I looked at her comments and she wrote that my essay was 55% likely generated by AI. I know for a fact that it wasn't because I typed it myself on the same computer I'm typing this post. I set up a meeting with her to discuss it and hopefully have her come to her senses but she just kept saying \"the evidence is there\" and pointed to the TurnItIn checker on her computer screen. She repeated that every time I spoke a word. She then said \"just study more for the next test. Do better.\" Meeting with her directly clearly didn't solve anything so I submitted a complaint through my college's online complaint form. I included a screenshot of her comments on my essay as well as a quote from TurnItIn's website that says its tool should not be used as the basis for adverse action against a student and that it does not determine academic misconduct. I haven't heard back from anyone yet but I'm terrified that I could be expelled for this and I'm losing out on my tuition reimbursement from my employer because it dropped my grade in the class by a lot. I don't know what I can do to prove that I wrote my essay and not an AI. Is there a way to prove it? I can't use Google Docs version history because I wrote it in a text box on the testing software, so that's out of the question. I didn't screen record myself writing it either because I didn't think I would have to. I'm completely lost.",
