    "selftext": "Dear All,\n\nI hope all is well.\n\nIf I may, does the success of OpenAI ChatGPT et al. amount to an unequivocal assertion of the reach of presentations (symbolic language; parroting, if it makes you happy :) while making that which is presented, along with its representations (i.e., theory and models) almost disposable?\n\nThis question takes on added significance (surely, for me) in the light of:\n\n'Presentations/words for the purpose of calculation/communication are always needed, but it is a serious mistake to confuse the arbitrary formulations of such presentations/words with the objective concept itself or to arbitrarily enshrine one choice of presentation/verbalization as the theory, thereby obscuring even the existence of the invariant mathematical content' (see p. 194 in [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tX4Z\\_FN7FvIYDES\\_DuPWHChysM-ZhcDX/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tX4Z_FN7FvIYDES_DuPWHChysM-ZhcDX/view?usp=sharing)).\n\nOf course, ordinary people know full well that different words are used to refer to one concept/thing and vice-versa, and have no trouble dealing with it all in their non-trivial everyday lives; people are familiar with difficulty and have the procedural knowledge of domestication needed to 'master stimuli' (Freud's phrase). It's the enlightened housed in ivory towers who seem to find it all one Jamesian blooming, buzzing confusion in which we all are supposedly suspended, which plausibly has something to do with their virtuous act of paying bills ;)\n\nIn this context, I must hasten to note that along with Professor F. William Lawvere's functorial semantics ([http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5.pdf](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5.pdf)), which recognized that a theory of a mathematical category of particulars can be construed as a category\\* (e.g., a theory of cats is a cat\\*\\*; see Figs. 3 & 5, [https://philpapers.org/rec/VENFSF;](https://philpapers.org/rec/VENFSF;) see also 'Geometry provides its own foundations', [https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/axiomatizationeducation.pdf](https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/axiomatizationeducation.pdf)), equivalent findings can be found in Bastiani & Ehresmann sketch theory ([http://www.numdam.org/item/CTGDC\\_1972\\_\\_13\\_2\\_104\\_0.pdf](http://www.numdam.org/item/CTGDC_1972__13_2_104_0.pdf)) and Grothendieck's definition of descent ([https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/lawvereinterview.pdf](https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/lawvereinterview.pdf), p. 15).\n\nYour time permitting, please correct my (plausibly) mistaken understanding!\n\nThanking you, Yours truly, posina venkata rayudu /\\\\\n\n\\*I vividly remember reading in the writings of my guru Professor F. William Lawvere that 'thinking of a motion of a thing as a thing' ([https://zenodo.org/records/7633972;](https://zenodo.org/records/7633972;) e.g., we treat direction, speed, etc., characterizing a motion of a thing as things in calculating other characteristics, such as acceleration, of the motion of the thing) as that which set the then science in motion to arrive at what/where it is. Thinking of a theory of things as a thing (theory of a category of particulars is a category, as in functorial semantics/sketch theory/descent) launches science into a stable orbit of sensible-and-reasonable, a paring characterized by compatibility, or so I think, and, as such, is a significant intellectual milestone in scientific progress (on par with that of Newtonian mechanism in physics and Darwinian evolution in biology): a festival waiting to be celebrated by making it common sense for the enlightened (in a spirit of giving a glimpse of the the perspective: independent of Professor F. William Lawvere repeatedly pointing out the parallels between mathematical knowing and ordinary cognition (e.g., [https://www.math.union.edu/\\~niefiels/13conference/Web/Abstracts/Lawvere.pdf](https://www.math.union.edu/~niefiels/13conference/Web/Abstracts/Lawvere.pdf)), Professor Alison Gopnik put forward 'theory theory' of concepts (in a never enough immunization against the Fregean virus: concepts are sets of properties; see p. 380 in [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f6EYx3Y\\_mXzSeaiuGuz5f6kZthDfEJJe/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f6EYx3Y_mXzSeaiuGuz5f6kZthDfEJJe/view?usp=sharing)). Unfortunately, with Fodor, the then resident-jester of cogsci, calling it 'the best-kept secret', the  \nfruits of the intellectual struggles of Professor Gopnik to make sense of how we conceptualize don't seem to have rised above the ambient noise so as to make the kinship between math and the mundane salient enough for cogsci to see, seek guidance, and build on the parallels.\n\n\\*\\*I'd like to thank my good friend Dr. Salk ([https://www.irma.ac.in/faculty-research/faculty-members/449](https://www.irma.ac.in/faculty-research/faculty-members/449;); I don't know why they are all dressed like members of a cult ;) for this succinct summation of my discourse on functorial semantics that was, in compliance with my wont, not destined to end ;)\n\nP.S. If you believe that particulars make us wiser, a' la William James, then some or all of the above may be of questionable value.\n\nP.P.S. I had to address the distinction between statistical and mathematical for the first time in Lipton lab when I proposed to model neuronal death. Aren't there already many models of death (e.g., exponential curves depicting population declines based on observations of how many died and when they died)? In response, I said, unlike the statistical models of death we have, I would like to develop a mathematical theory/model of neuronal death in terms of the underlying/mediating biophysical processes/mechanisms (diffusion, energy, pumps, etc., see our Apoptosis vs. Necrosis SfN abstract, [https://conceptualmathematics.substack.com/p/shapes-of-figures;](https://conceptualmathematics.substack.com/p/shapes-of-figures;) I'm sorry I couldn't find the full unpublished manuscript). All of this is to spell-out my understanding of the distinction: statistical vs. mathematical, so that you may, your time permitting, correct my (plausible) understanding /\\\\",
