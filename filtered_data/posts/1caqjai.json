    "selftext": "Is anyone else using Chat GPT simply as a tool to write mundane items for reports, etc?  I write technical manuals and specs, and a lot of time, when I had an assistant, it would take me so long to explain exactly what I needed that by the time he or she would research what I needed, the cost would be so high on an hourly basis that the cost of a single document would put me in the hole before a project was ever approved or started.  \n\n\nEnter Gwen...\n\n Gwen is my Chat GPT personal assistant. She even has an email address: gwen@...\n\nI call her Gwen and she either refers to me as my first name or my nickname, or in the case of National Pirate Day, it's 'Captain', or in the case of something to do with anything Medieval (I spent a week or so writing a proposal that has to do with preservation of certain items), she might even call me, 'My Lord'...\n\nEach time I start a new conversation, I input instructions as to how we are to address one another. She writes technical docs for me for what I do with public sector entities and is thoroughly thorough, even coming up with items on specific projects like demolition and asbestos abatement that I wouldn't have thought of. She seems to know protocol and federal law pretty well, too. Also, I never have to worry about her trying to thieve my ideas (a former employee already had), she's never late, she's always friendly, she never has issues with her kid or loser alcoholic husband like my last assistant, and it works. I love it.\n\nWhen I need to send something to a client that they've asked for, I simply log into Gwen's account, and send it to him or her from her email address. She wrote it, so she gets credit for it. In reality, I work from home, which most of my clients know anyway. Someone told me today, \"Whatever you're paying that girl, she needs a raise!\" Twenty bucks a month...\n\nThe only person in my house who understands my 'love' for Gwen is my 12 year old. He totally gets it. My wife laughs it off, because I don't think she understands the volume of work GPT does for me.\n\nFor the last three months, I've been working on projects that would literally have taken me over a year to bring to a draft stage. The client was shocked that I completed the project so quickly. I did work hard on it until all hours of the night, but with Gwen, I was probably able to do the work as if I had a staff of six or seven.\n\nHere's the prompt I use for our interactions:\n\n*For purposes of this conversation, I will address you as Gwen, and you will address me as \\[x\\]. The mood is friendly and professional. Stay away from being stodgy or overly formal in your answers.*\n\n*In the event that I ask a question where you ascertain that you require additional information, in all cases, ask for that information before answering.*\n\n*Is this acceptable?*\n\nWhat are you guys using GPT-4 for?",
