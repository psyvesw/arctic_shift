    "selftext": "I\u2019m attempting to feed ChatGPT the instruction rule-set for a board game to see if it can play against a human player effectively, much the way AI chess would play. \n\nWhen playing, the map consists of map tiles, consisting of terrain types. \n\nThe shape of each mtileile consists of 10 hexagons. The overall tile shape, however, is irregular. Top to bottom, \n\nrow 1: 2 hexes\nrow 2: 3 hexes\nrow 3: 2 hexes\nrow 4: 2 hexes\nrow 5: 1 hex\n\nThis could prob be rotated to have it make more sense, but this is the orientation chat gpt picked. \n\nI was able to successfully have ChatGPT store the contents of each hex from 16 different map tiles. I confirmed a few times and went back-and-forth to make sure that it had it right.\n\nWhen it came time to placing the base map tiles, it continually would switch up the contents of hexes, and sometimes tell me that it didn\u2019t have any of the details; that we should creat a database consisting of all the terrain hexes (which I had already done), and when I reminded ChatGPT, it said ~\u201coh yeah\u201c.) The most frustrating part came when asking it which hexes from two tiles would touch it I brought them together to connect like a jigsaw puzzle. I\u2019d ask it to tell me the cooridnates that touch in this format:\n\n\u201cMaptile1 #: coordinate (1-10) / its contents -> Maptile 2 #: coordinate. \n\nThe terrain type it gave for a given connecting hex was sometimes wrong. But when going back and asking for the summary of that maps tile, it would be correct. \n\nEven with its own realizations, however, after a few iterations of corrections, it finally said that it doesn\u2019t store relational data in the traditional way. And that if we wanted to continue, tracking complexities like these, it would either need to see the board or we\u2019d have to use a separate tool.\n\nObviously, it would be cool if I could just have it remember everything. I did attempt to take pictures, which worked a little bit. But information that it gathers from pictures, for some reason can\u2019t be kept. The next day I came back, the pictures were gone, and it said I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about even though it output the results in text.\n\nI even tried communicating with it through ascii art, which it initially suggested. That started out great too. The bottleneck, however, always comes down to it hallucinating incorrect data which it not only has, but output correctly when first asking for a summary of each map tile. \n\n Anyone know of a good way to have ChatGPT track where each of 2 players are on the map more consistently?
