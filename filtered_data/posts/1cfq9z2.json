    "selftext": "For context: I was a straight C student in high school way back when, so I have less than zero authority in the world of science. After a bad trip I had (you know the kind) about three years ago, I've been curious about spacetime in general but in a \"bro science\" kind of way. I asked ChatGPT what it thought about a theory I'd been developing which explores a different take on the block universe theory. I then asked it to write a short essay to better explain this theory. It took some back and forth and asking ChatGPT to critique itself, then rewrite the essay based on those critiques. It still had issues with repetition, so I asked it to summarize the essay it had written, then forget all other versions of the essay and rewrite it from scratch based on its own summary and below is what it came up with, albeit shorter than previous versions. I kept a title from an earlier version since I liked it better but I made sure to make no other edits of my own, making revisions only by asking ChatGPT to do so itself. Thought this was a fun experiment on how ChatGPT could help someone with formal education of a subject form new ideas and communicate them. \n\n  \n**Title: The Lichtenberg Universe: Dynamic Realities and the Nature of Time**\n\n**Introduction**  \nTraditional views of the universe often present time as a linear progression within a static four-dimensional spacetime continuum. This perspective, known as the block universe theory, posits that all moments\u2014past, present, and future\u2014exist simultaneously but are experienced sequentially. Challenging this static model, the Lichtenberg Universe theory introduces a dynamic element that transforms our understanding of time and reality. This theory suggests that a branching, dynamic energy, similar to the patterns seen in Lichtenberg figures created by electrical discharges, actively traverses and reshapes the spacetime block, irreversibly activating and altering its realities.\n\n**The Lichtenberg Universe Theory**  \nIn the Lichtenberg Universe model, spacetime is not merely a backdrop for events but a canvas of latent potentialities awaiting activation. This dynamic energy does not follow pre-established paths but creates its own, similar to the unpredictable branching in Lichtenberg figures. As it moves through the spacetime continuum, this energy selects which realities to activate, consuming their specific conditions in the process. Once a path is activated, it is permanently altered\u2014its original state is forever changed, rendering its previous potentialities inaccessible. This irreversible process represents the forward flow of time as experienced from our human perspective.\n\n**Implications for Time and Reality**  \nThe introduction of dynamic energy to the block universe theory profoundly impacts our understanding of time and reality. Time is no longer a static dimension through which events unfold predictably but is an active, molding force that dictates the unfolding of events based on the paths chosen by this dynamic energy. This view challenges the notion of determinism, suggesting that while all potential outcomes exist, only those realized by the energy's passage truly come to fruition. Philosophically, this raises questions about the nature of unactivated realities\u2014do they possess any form of existence if they are never realized? Moreover, this theory suggests that our conventional understanding of time as linear and unidirectional is merely a human interpretation of how this energy interacts with the spacetime continuum.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe Lichtenberg Universe model offers a revolutionary perspective on the cosmos, illustrating the universe not as a pre-determined series of events laid out in spacetime but as a dynamic entity continually shaped by the energetic paths that forge, activate, and transform its realities. This theory enriches our understanding of the universe's structure, compelling us to reconsider fundamental aspects of time, space, and existence. By viewing time and reality through the lens of dynamic energy, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity and ever-evolving nature of the cosmos.",
