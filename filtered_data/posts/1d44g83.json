    "selftext": "I use ChatGPT everyday and I teach about it too.  But I still often struggle to find cool use cases about it.  (I don't blame ChatGPT for this, I blame my own lack of creativity)\n\nYesterday I found a cool one.  I was tired of typing on the computer so I went on a walk.  \n\nI had an idea for an article I wanted to write (I often get good ideas while I'm walking).\n\nI pulled out my phone and used otter ai (a free app) to record and transcribe my thoughts.  I'm sure there are other voice recorders and transcribers too.  Doesn't matter which one you use. \n\nI just held the phone to my face and talked into it.  People around me thought I was just talking on the phone.\n\nI was rambling on and on with just a stream of consciousness.  A lot of \"ums and ahs\".  The whole thing was just me rambling about ideas I wanted in an article.  \n\nHere's the cool part.  When I got home, I emailed the text of what I said to myself, and uploaded it into ChatGPT.\n\n**I prompted:**  \"Here is what I said while I was out on a walk.  Organize these thoughts, format them with bullet points and headings, and turn it into an article for me\".\n\nI didn't know what to expect, because the input was so pathetic.  \n\nBut I was really impressed with what came back.  ChatGPT was able to organize everything I said in a really cool way.  It formatted it, and didn't add in any dumb points of its own. \n\nI used the template it gave me as a backbone, put it into Google Docs, and I'd say this process saved at least 50% of the time it would normally take to write an article.\n\nHas anyone tried this, or something similar?",
