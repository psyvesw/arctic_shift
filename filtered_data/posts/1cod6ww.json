    "selftext": "For context they had asked which model is best for general use, and mentioned they wanted to try Grok since they didn't want to deal with a LLM that was woke. So that's why that part is mentioned. I realized I left out Gemini, but I genuinely just feel everything it can do, something else does better.\n\n\n\nI primarily use \\*\\*GPT-4\\*\\*. No one has come close on overall usage. There are some that have passed it in single categories, but despite having tried (and paying for) all of the top models, I always come back to ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nThe only other one I would consider is \\*\\*Claude 3 Opus\\*\\*. But I only really use Claude for summarizing really long documents and for really complex coding projects. I do think it is a bit better of a writer than ChatGPT, but that can mostly be solved with a Custom GPT.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Grok\\*\\* is fine, but I wouldn't ever use it for anything other than toying around with and maybe as a search for breaking new consider it uses tweets as context.\n\n\n\nI use \\*\\*LLaMa3\\*\\* for use inside of coding projects, but wouldn't suggest it for normal use.\n\n\n\nI think the wokeness of these LLMs is mostly blown out of proportion. Like, just to test it, I asked ChatGPT to write a defense for why Hitler's followers would have supported him and it fulfilled it, but did append a \"but understanding these reasons don't imply justification\".\n\n\\[Hitler Example\\](https://chat.openai.com/share/e01e2245-1e05-4dc5-b636-22949a63e7ff)\n\n\n\nThen I also did a one of \"Why should I vote for Trump\" and it gave an answer without any sort of backpedaling.\n\n\\[Trump Example\\](https://chat.openai.com/share/3be4760a-b659-4744-a1c7-aa0915dc7a70)\n\n\n\nOpenAI just released their \"\\[Model Spec\\](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-model-spec/)\" which is an attempt to be more transparent and list out what their expected behavior of the model is. There is only one thing I saw in there I would maybe label as \"woke\", but I honestly never run into anything in my normal use that has felt affected by any ideology around that. \n\n\n\nIn risk of making this way too long, here are features that ChatGPT has that no other model has all in one right now:\n\n\n\n- \\*\\*File Search\\*\\*: Can upload an image, PDF, Word Doc, Text file, CSV, and it will be able to use it as a resource (Claude can also do this)\n\n- \\*\\*Code Interpreter\\*\\*: Can write and run code within the app. This may sound like something technical you wouldn't need, but this allows it to do Math reliably (Something other LLMs fail at), it can create a CSV/text file for you to download, create graphs/charts from data, and some other nice stuff.\n\n- \\*\\*Image Generation\\*\\*: Mid-Journey is king for this, but ChatGPT is decent, and you can do fine tune edits after, which I don't think any other one currently has\n\n- \\*\\*Browsing\\*\\*: All the models have a knowledge cutoff date, Grok uses Twitter to be a little more up-to-date, but ChatGPT can search and gives you sources to refer as well.\n\n- \\*\\*Custom GPTs\\*\\*: You can create a model focused on specific processes, or use others that people have made. One example is I was learning Final Cut Pro and the base LLMs would hallucinate answers - but some created a FCP GPT and gave it documentation so it gave solid grounded answers.\n\n- \\*\\*Custom Instruction/Memory\\*\\*: This one is huge for me. You can let it know how you like to have it respond to you and it will remember it in every session while all the other LLMs you will have to remind every session. This can range from \"Avoid bias\" to \"I use a Mac\" so it knows to give to balanced answers and give you tech advice in context of a Mac ecosystem.",
