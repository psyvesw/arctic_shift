    "selftext": "We are playing HaxBall with a couple of my friends. It has game rooms, and most of them are automated and hosted on servers. Our room was closed two weeks ago, so we didn\u2019t have a chance to play. My friends were saying we could cover the whole cost, but we didn\u2019t know how to set it up. So, I took responsibility, believing in ChatGPT-4, and started working on it.\n\n\n\nFirst, I asked ChatGPT what I should do and what steps I needed to take. ChatGPT provided each step to me and also gave me the necessary codes. I rented a VPS on DigitalOcean, installed Ubuntu, and then installed Google Chrome. After that, I uploaded the bot and made it run indefinitely. I added some functions to the bot, connected it to a Discord channel, and added functionalities like !calladmin. I also connected Discord to my Telegram to get immediate notifications for admin calls, etc.\n\n  \nOf course it didn't worked perfectly. I got so much troubles but I fixed that issues by searching on the web and trying to find a proper ways. But as a result, all of this was possible thanks to ChatGPT. It also helped me gain some reputation because I am now the owner of the room. No one can say anything to me even I play really terrible :)\n\nChatGPT is great for small projects like this!",
