    "selftext": "Apart from technical occupations, most people's work does not require creating content that does not currently exist, but rather involves following the workflow of their respective occupations, such as entering real-world data into computers (here, computers refer not only to PCs but also to those embedded in industrial equipment, medical devices, and service facilities).\n\nI am not familiar with the working environment of developed countries; I am in China, where there is much lagging behind. Many devices require specialized personnel for operation (such as operating color ultrasound equipment and CT equipment in hospitals, operating pick-and-place machines and setting equipment parameters in factories, and entering customer loan and investment information in banks). In China, most people in real life are engaged in such occupations that require human operation of equipment or data entry. Due to the fixed operating processes, chatgpt's capabilities are limited in this regard.\n\nBecause I am in China, the market here is not as open and free as in developed countries. Due to the high degree of monopoly in the upstream and midstream industries (my friends in developed countries, you cannot imagine the extent of monopoly), salespeople here attach great importance to personal relationships with customers and suppliers. Although there is also formal email communication, many specific business decisions are often made through face-to-face meetings (with some tricks involved). Therefore, even though salespeople reply to emails and prepare product briefs, service briefs, etc., they almost never use artificial intelligence like chatgpt.\n\nThe people around me were amazed when they first encountered ChatGPT, saying it was so powerful, only Americans could create something like this. However, after using it for half an hour to an hour, some of them gave feedback that it was not useful and felt like a toy. I think this is related to their job types, as their job types have made them accustomed to a certain process or pattern for a long time, and as long as they apply this process or pattern, they can get the results they want. What they hope for is that ChatGPT can allow them to keep their hands off the keyboard and mouse, even automatically reply to emails, and just lie down to collect their salary.",
