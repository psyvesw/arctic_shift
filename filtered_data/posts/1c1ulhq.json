    "selftext": "\nNot too long ago, I launched a website called [Seekme.ai](https://www.seekme.ai) - it's essentially an AI tools aggregator. The main idea was to create a go-to place for anyone looking to find AI tools that could help with their work, projects, or just out of curiosity. We've managed to compile a directory of over 12,000 AI tools, which is kind of crazy when you think about it. Users can sift through this massive list by their profession, the specific task they want to achieve, tags, or even just directly searching for the name of the tool if they have one in mind.\n\nThrough the process of reviewing and curating over 12,000 AI tools, I've gained some unique insights into the industry's trends, hype, and future direction. There have been some real eye-openers, and I'm excited to share what I've learned with the community.\n\n\nThe Process & Insights\n\nBuilding and curating the Seekme.ai directory of over 12,000 AI tools has been a fascinating and eye-opening process. It started with scouring the web, searching high and low for any and all AI-powered applications, services, and platforms we could find. We left no stone unturned - scouring product directories, tech blogs, crowdsourced lists, and even diving into the depths of obscure corners of the internet.\n\nThe sheer volume of AI tools out there is staggering. When we first started, we thought compiling a few hundred would be a major achievement. But as we dug deeper, the numbers just kept growing and growing. It seemed like every day, new AI tools were popping up, covering an increasingly diverse range of use cases.\n\nOne of the key insights we gained is just how fragmented and chaotic the AI tools landscape currently is. There's no rhyme or reason to how these tools are being developed and released. We found everything from large tech companies unveiling their latest AI-powered offerings, to solo developers releasing niche tools on Product Hunt. The quality, features, and pricing varied wildly.\n\nAnother pattern we noticed is the tendency for many AI tools to be quite narrow and specialized. Sure, there are some generalist AI assistants making headlines, but the majority of the tools we cataloged were focused on solving very specific problems - things like AI-powered writing assistants, data visualization tools, customer service chatbots, and so on. The level of granularity is quite remarkable.\n\nAt the same time, we were surprised by the sheer number of AI tools that are essentially just rebranded versions of existing non-AI software. It seems like every SaaS company is now trying to hop on the AI bandwagon, even if their products don't truly leverage AI in any meaningful way. The \"AI-washing\" phenomenon is real, and users need to be discerning.\n\nOne of the strengths we consistently saw across many AI tools was the focus on user-friendliness and accessibility. Developers seem to understand that for AI to truly go mainstream, the technology needs to be easy to use and require minimal technical expertise. The rise of no-code/low-code AI tools is a testament to this trend.\n\nHowever, a major weakness we encountered was the lack of transparency and explainability when it comes to how these AI tools actually work under the hood. Many companies are very cagey about the details of their models and algorithms, making it hard for users to truly understand the capabilities and limitations. This opacity could become a bigger issue as AI becomes more pervasive.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise for us was just how quickly the AI tools landscape is evolving. It feels like the pace of innovation and new releases is accelerating every month. Keeping up with all the changes has been a constant challenge, and I can only imagine how dizzying it must feel for the average person trying to navigate this space.\n\nOverall, the process of building [Seekme.ai](https://www.seekme.ai) has given me a unique, insider's perspective on the current state of the AI tools industry. The scale, diversity, strengths, weaknesses, and rapid pace of change are all things I'll be keeping a close eye on as I try to anticipate where things are headed next.\n\nBefore I go to my prediction I would like to highlight that  we've got this newsletter that we're pretty proud of. It's a neat little compilation of AI-related news, hacks, tips & tricks, and suggestions on tools that might be useful for our subscribers. We've been trying to add value where we can, keeping it rich with information but also light enough to not feel like homework, you know? You can subscribe to it here for free to get a bit of [AI knowledge delivered](https://seekme.ai/subscribe/newsletter) directly to your email\n\n\nPredictions & Advice\n\nBased on the insider perspective I've gained from building and curating the Seekme.ai directory, I have some strong predictions about where I think the AI tools space is headed in the next 1-3 years.\n\nFirst and foremost, I believe we're going to see a massive explosion in the use of generative AI tools - things like language models, text-to-image generators, and AI-powered content creation assistants. The recent breakthroughs in this area, exemplified by tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E, have captured the public's imagination. I expect these types of AI assistants to become ubiquitous, fundamentally changing how we approach all kinds of creative and knowledge work.\n\nAnother category I'm incredibly bullish on is AI-powered analytics and decision support tools. As more and more data becomes available, the ability to leverage AI to uncover insights, make predictions, and guide decision-making is going to be invaluable across industries. I anticipate a wave of sophisticated AI-infused business intelligence, forecasting, and risk management solutions hitting the market.\n\nOn the flip side, I think a lot of the current hype around \"AI-powered\" productivity and workflow tools is going to die down. Many of these tools are essentially just putting a thin veneer of AI over existing software functionality, without truly leveraging the technology in meaningful ways. As users become more discerning, I expect a lot of these tools to fade into obscurity.\n\nSimilarly, I'm skeptical about the long-term viability of many niche, single-purpose AI apps and services. The low barriers to entry mean we're seeing a proliferation of these tools, but most of them will likely struggle to gain traction and build sustainable businesses. The winners will be the ones that can seamlessly integrate into people's existing workflows and ecosystems.\n\nSo what's my advice for navigating this rapidly evolving AI tools landscape? First and foremost, be a critical consumer. Don't just take companies' AI claims at face value - dig into the details, understand the underlying technology, and assess whether it's truly adding value. Be wary of hype and marketing fluff.\n\nSecondly, focus on finding tools that solve real, tangible problems for you or your business. Don't get distracted by the shiny new thing - evaluate AI solutions based on their practical utility and ability to drive concrete outcomes. The AI landscape is crowded, so be selective.\n\nFinally, stay curious and keep learning. The field of AI is advancing at a breakneck pace, so it's important to continuously educate yourself on the latest developments, capabilities, and limitations. Follow industry news, experiment with new tools, and be open to rethinking your assumptions.\n\nThe AI tools space is undoubtedly going to continue transforming at a dizzying rate. But by adopting a discerning, problem-focused, and lifelong learning mindset, I believe anyone can navigate this landscape and find the AI-powered solutions that truly add value to their work and life.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs someone who has had an up-close and personal look at the current state of the AI tools landscape, I believe I've developed a unique perspective that could be incredibly useful for a wide range of people.\n\nFor starters, these insights are crucial for consumers and everyday users of technology. With AI becoming increasingly pervasive in our lives, it's important for people to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and evolving trends in this space. Knowing which tool categories are likely to see explosive growth, and which are just hype, can help individuals make informed decisions about which AI-powered solutions to adopt and incorporate into their workflows.\n\nBut these insights are also highly valuable for creators, entrepreneurs, and businesses looking to capitalize on the AI revolution. Understanding where the real opportunities lie, and where the threats of irrelevance loom, can inform critical strategic decisions about product development, investment, and long-term positioning. Armed with this knowledge, AI tool creators can make much more informed choices about where to focus their efforts.\n\nTo give you a sense of the scale we're talking about - our Seekme.ai directory has grown from 8,000 tools to over 12,000 in just the last 6 months. That's an increase of 50% in under a year. This underscores just how rapidly this space is evolving, and why staying on top of the trends is so crucial.\n\nSo I encourage all of you reading this to engage with me in a discussion about the future of AI tools. What are your own predictions and insights based on your experiences? Where do you see the most promising opportunities, and what concerns you most about the direction of this technology? I'm eager to learn from the collective wisdom of this community.\n\nAnd of course, I'd love for you to check out [Seekme.ai](https://www.seekme.ai) and explore the directory for yourself. See what new and innovative AI tools are out there, and let me know what you think. The more input and feedback I can get, the better I can make the platform and the more valuable it can be for everyone navigating this exciting but complex space and if you would like to know more of these in my [newsletter](https://seekme.ai/subscribe/newsletter) ",
