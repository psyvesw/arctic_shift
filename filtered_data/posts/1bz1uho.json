The kids are buzzing with excitement as they discuss the upcoming solar eclipse.\\]**\n\n**Stan:** Dude, did you hear about the eclipse happening next week?\n\n**Kyle:** Yeah, it's gonna be awesome! But we need to make sure we have those special glasses to watch it safely.\n\n**Cartman:** Glasses? Aw, crap! I forgot about that!\n\n**\\[Cut to the school cafeteria. The boys are sitting at their usual table.\\]**\n\n**Kenny (muffled):** (*Excited mumbling*)\n\n**Stan:** We need to find those glasses ASAP. My dad said they're selling out everywhere.\n\n**Kyle:** My mom tried ordering online, but they're all sold out there too.\n\n**Cartman:** Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go find some!\n\n**\\[The boys rush out of the cafeteria and onto the streets of South Park, determined to find eclipse glasses.\\]**\n\n**\\[Scene: South Park Mall. The boys enter the mall, where chaos ensues.\\]**\n\n**Stan:** Look at this line at the electronics store!\n\n**Kyle:** And the prices are outrageous!\n\n**Cartman:** Screw this, we need a plan.\n\n**\\[The boys huddle together, whispering and scheming.\\]**\n\n**\\[Scene: The boys split up to search for glasses in different parts of town.\\]**\n\n**Stan:** (*in a hardware store*) Excuse me, do you have any eclipse glasses left?\n\n**Employee:** Sorry, kid. We sold out weeks ago.\n\n**\\[Meanwhile, Cartman is at the library, rummaging through books and files.\\]**\n\n**Cartman:** There has to be some forgotten stash of eclipse glasses in here somewhere!\n\n**\\[Kyle is at the local convenience store, desperately searching through the shelves.\\]**\n\n**Kyle:** Please tell me you have some eclipse glasses hidden away somewhere!\n\n**Store Clerk:** Afraid not, kid. They've been gone for weeks.\n\n**\\[Cut to Randy Marsh's house. Stan knocks on the door.\\]**\n\n**Stan:** Dad, do you have any eclipse glasses?\n\n**Randy:** Sorry, son. I thought I had some, but it turns out they were just 3D movie glasses.\n\n**\\[Disheartened, Stan rejoins his friends in the street.\\]**\n\n**Stan:** It's hopeless, guys. We're never going to find eclipse glasses in time.\n\n**Cartman:** Wait a minute... I have an idea!\n\n**\\[Scene: The boys gather in Cartman's basement, surrounded by makeshift equipment.\\]**\n\n**Cartman:** Behold, my brilliant plan! We're going to make our own eclipse glasses!\n\n**Kyle:** Are you serious? How?\n\n**Cartman:** With tin foil, cardboard, and a little bit of duct tape, anything is possible!\n\n**\\[The boys spend the next few days crafting their homemade eclipse glasses, laughing and bonding over their ridiculous creation.\\]**\n\n**\\[Scene: The day of the eclipse. The boys gather in Cartman's backyard, wearing their homemade glasses.\\]**\n\n**Stan:** Wow, it actually worked!\n\n**Kyle:** This is amazing!  \n\n\n**\\[Scene: Kenny explodes and no one notices because they're wearing eclipse glasses.\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cartman:** See? I told you my plan would work!\n\n**\\[The boys watch in awe as the solar eclipse unfolds above them, their homemade glasses protecting their eyes.\\]**\n\n**\\[Fade out as the boys enjoy the celestial spectacle, grateful for their friendship and ingenuity.\\]**\n\n**\\[End of episode.\\]**",
