    "selftext": "I was at the National portrait gallery today in Washington DC. On a whim i put in my earbud and opened GPT and used the Audio function to talk to it. As i wandered through I would ask it about the subjects in the painting and other questions and it was like having a tour guide in my ear. I imagined this at scale for school and other applications and went down a rabbit hole. It was super relaxing to just sit or stand and have the information spoken to me. a fair portion of it was written on the plaques but i was able to glean so much more and was able to ask follow ups or dig down on more focused subjects.\n\n  \nI know that they already have this in virtual tours and audio tours but it was so personalized and curated i really loved the experience. I can imagine with the advancement of these programs its only going to get better.\n\n  \nLike imagine giving an earpiece to your kids and they ask hey mom/dad who it this and then the information is given to them. Even better a school group let loose and each kid can find something that speaks to them and they can explore it hand free not on a screen but with a almost id call it a \"teacher\" in their ear. I would have killed for something like this when i was a kid. With the new update that will allow us to use the camera to have it see things imagine going to historical sites like Gettysburg for example and having the LLM walk us through the events. Wait until we have AR and it can show us what happened and what things looked like back then. This will usher in a whole new way to educate and spark peoples interest in history and everything else.\n\n  \nI just wanted to share and hope some of you try it out. \n\n  \nThis century is gonna be awesome.",
