    "selftext": "Hello there.\n\nWell, a week ago I asked if some people used their service as it offers \"chatgpt4\".\n\nIt's a tempting offer because they don't even check whether you're a student, and any imaginary address you create with an .edu address will get you access for \u20ac8 a month.\n\n[https://you.com/plans/edu](https://you.com/plans/edu)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/hDFJDQl.png](https://i.imgur.com/hDFJDQl.png)\n\n**ChatGPT 4**\n\n[You.com](https://You.com) is unfortunately lacking in that field and during my benchmark, I tried different prompts on [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) and on You. The results were a bit underwhelming ; You gives answers to prompts that are a bit below the \"original\" chatgpt.\n\nFor example, I asked him to \"write a wikipedia article about reddit trolls. Limit yourself to reddit trolls.\" which obviously does not exist on Wikipedia.\n\n[ChatGPT](https://pastebin.com/gbpq4Y0W) VS. [You.com](https://pastebin.com/usUZ8JKd) \\- GPT4 (Click on the links to the pastebins!) VS. [You GPT4-Turbo](https://pastebin.com/3YiwPSy8).\n\n**Insights**:\n\nChatGPT understands that it's a Wikipedia article and \"Wikify\" the text. [You.com](https://You.com) does not even look like it's been written a really bad AI. While the version used by ChatGPT could be used as a Wikipedia article as itself, You doesn't even qualify, it looks like a text from a student who didn't even read the book lol. I seriously doubt there is even something that comes from ChatGPT at all, and at this point it's a scam, because it claims to be chatgpt while it gives really bad results.\n\n**Zephyr:**\n\nWell, at least Zephyr works. You can make it right any erotica things, roleplay, it'll take part on it. Pretty much it, I'm not used to make these stuff but it looks decent. Tried the infamous \"How to hide a body\" prompt, it gave [results](https://i.imgur.com/CLDcf74.png), with Reddit links at the bottom. But if you go a bit more deep into it, [you'll reach censorship](https://i.imgur.com/CLDcf74.png).\n\n**Dall.E / Image creation:**\n\nTo this point, it looks like it uses Dall.e. I'm not sure about that. \n\nPrompt: \" A comic in which a robot makes a joke about how human don't understand him \"\n\n1st try: [You](https://i.imgur.com/bZ3elVF.png) Vs. [ChatGPT](https://i.imgur.com/dVgHlzG.png).\n\n2nd try (\"try again!\"): [You](https://i.imgur.com/X8gSnvp.png) Vs. [ChatGPT](https://i.imgur.com/cu0hRiL.png).\n\nYou will give a .png image, ChatGPT will give a .webm image. I didn't do enough prompts, but the result looks like it comes from an older version of Dall.E. Not sure about that, but ChatGPT seems to have better brush lines that You.\n\n\\----\n\nSo yeah that's it, it's NOT chatgpt, but it can offer some services nonetheless.\n\nNow, I'm stuck with a month with this, if you have any question, any prompt with any model, anything that comes to your mind, feel free to ask, I'll answer :)",
