    "selftext": "Hi! So I'm an analyst tying to use ChatGPT to automate manual tasks, something it can allegedly do vey well so I'm excited, but running into questions and I'm wondering if the community could help on whether there is a solution.\n\nSo I work with data tables day in day out. One of the things I do is creating summary tables based on large, overly detailed tables (for example, I might have the \"number of customers\" per month, per, country, per region, per age etc, and I would create many tables to to just show the number of customers by month only, by country only etc.). I would then use these to create charts, put the charts into a PPT and comment, individual things that I'm ChatGPT excels in I believe.\n\nThis is my experience trying to make stage 1 (excel) happen so far:  \nUse the \"Data Analyst\" plugin, upload raw data CSV, ask it to make the tables in a single sheet. The result that it could create the tables how I wanted (simple instructions) in around 7/10 times, and rest is some random, very ugly spreadsheet. After some research I discovered that replicability is not something ChatGPT does as its working on \"probabilities\" when deciding what it does, but you can set the \"temperature\" of it i.e. how creative it gets (and therefore it could be more consistent). Unfortunately, you can only do this in the API, so I've tried to work with that but that failed as you can't upload a file through the API the same way as you can through the web interface. Another go was to try making an Assistant API but when I tried to upload a CSV file, it said the data type is not supported, it can't work with CSV files it seems?\n\nBottom line, I'd like to perform simple excel things in a replicable matter (95% fine, I can try again every now and then), do you know what to try next?\n\nI'd love to move onto creating charts and PPTs with it, but I can't do so if I can't do the basics with minimum temperature (on an acceptable level of replicability). So far it feels ChatGPT is a lot of hit and miss but I'm sure I could use it better.",
