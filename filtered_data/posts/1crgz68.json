    "selftext": "I\u2019m having a problem with GPT4o. It\u2019s too fast. \n\nSearching or asking questions allowed for me to read while it was producing, allowing me to learn quickly as though I was  having a conversation. \n\nWith 4o, it moves so fast I now see the whole thing before it\u2019s done. This is a problem that I think OpenAI needs to address. \n\n1.  When you read at the speed of the output, you see the \u201cthought process\u201d through the format. You see an outline and a line of reasoning and absorb more because of that. \n\n2. It allowed you to predict where it would go, thereby allowing you to critically think and better understand new information. \n\n3. It was less intimidating. This one is unique to everyone. But if I see a whole page I will quickly look for the answer in it instead of reading the whole thing, which others may prefer. As I do, but it\u2019s not what I WOULD do. \n\nI can see how some want the full page response and then skim for the answer. I think that further \u201cdumbs the product down\u201d for the sake of speed. Don\u2019t make your users just see the full thing so they further skim for their answer, push people into learning how to think again. To learn how to ask questions and probe away at something. I think AI has the ability to fix our society by teaching users that things are complex and nuanced and that will make us better people. But making things faster will change that. In my opinion at least. All I ask is that it is something to consider. \n\nMy solution? Have a slider that changes the output speed. \u201cComfortable\u201d and \u201cdefault\u201d. The same product, but it slows down the output to a more comfortable speed. Even during slow downs or light usage default will just go at the normal speed, even if that gets slow for various reasons. One is consistent one is default. ",
