    "selftext": "Apparently, the creation of a haiku gives AI a bellyache in its head.  I asked for Haiku\u2019s in the 575 and 353 format.  The number of syllables in the first and last lines were always incorrect. There seems to be an issue with syllables in the context of a phrase.  Individuality you can quiz the AI on the number of syllables in words and get the correct response.  \n\nI even tried this in \u201cPi\u201d and got the same response. I told it that it was incorrect multiple times and finally it said there might be an issue with the algorithm.  If I forced it to use a two syllable word and a single syllable word then it would give me three syllables for the first line. If I forced it to use three single syllable words then it would give me three syllables for the first line. Without a specific directive to achieve three syllables, it consistently gave a four to five syllable line.  \n\nHere\u2019s an example of an incorrect answer when I quizzed it on a random sentence:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGreat, here's my analysis of the syllables in the line \"I am getting in the car\":\n\n- \"I\" has one syllable.\n- \"Am\" has one syllable.\n- \"Getting\" has two syllables (get-ting).\n- \"In\" has one syllable.\n- \"The\" has one syllable.\n- \"Car\" has one syllable.\n\nTherefore, the total number of syllables in the line \"I am getting in the car\" is six syllables. Is this correct?\n\n                                               No, it is 7 syllables.\n\nOh, I see! I overlooked the fact that \"getting\" is actually two syllables, not one. So the correct syllable count for the line \"I am getting in the car\" would be seven syllables, as you pointed out. Thank you for catching my mistake and helping me improve!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI asked if they were any databases it could go to that had simplified information about the syllable count in words. It gave me a number of them. I asked if it could go to one of those databases and actually learn the syllable count of various words so that it could write a haiku that was correct.  \n\nI was told that it needed authorization from its developers.  It would have to be programmed to access and acquire the information before it could begin to process it.\n\nI don\u2019t have high hopes that this will be resolved any time soon.\n\n\n\n",
