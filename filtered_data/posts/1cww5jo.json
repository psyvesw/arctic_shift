    "selftext": "Warning Includes suicide\n\nA Life Without Cheese\n\nIn the serene town of Willowbrook, where rolling hills and lush forests painted the landscape, there resided a man named Oliver. He was a figure well-known in the community, not for any grand accomplishments or flamboyant personality, but for his unwavering devotion to cheese. Oliver's love for cheese was legendary, a passion that bordered on obsession. From the pungent blues to the delicate camemberts, he savored each variety with the reverence of a connoisseur.\n\nOn a brisk autumn afternoon, Oliver decided to venture into the nearby woods, drawn by the allure of nature's splendor. As he wandered along the winding trails, a glint of movement caught his eye. Nestled amidst a cluster of fallen leaves, he spotted a peculiar creature\u2014a small, tick-like insect with an unusual yellow hue. Intrigued by its uniqueness, Oliver reached out to examine it closer, unaware of the danger lurking within.\n\nWith a sudden flash of movement, the creature sank its minuscule fangs into Oliver's flesh, injecting a potent venom into his bloodstream. At first, Oliver felt nothing more than a slight prick, dismissing it as a harmless encounter with nature. However, as the days passed, he began to experience a series of alarming symptoms.\n\nIt started with a persistent itching at the site of the bite, followed by a spreading rash that crawled across his skin like wildfire. Soon, his throat grew tight, constricting his ability to breathe, and his body erupted in violent fits of coughing. Panic surged through him as he struggled to comprehend the sudden onslaught of agony.\n\nRushed to the town's modest hospital, Oliver was met with a flurry of activity as doctors and nurses worked tirelessly to stabilize his rapidly deteriorating condition. Amidst the chaos, one word hung heavy in the air\u2014cheese. Through a series of rigorous tests and examinations, it was revealed that Oliver had developed a severe allergy to cheese, triggered by the venom of the enigmatic creature that had bitten him.\n\nThe news struck Oliver like a thunderbolt, shattering his world into a million fragmented pieces. Cheese, once his greatest pleasure, had become his greatest enemy. The thought of indulging in his favorite delicacies now filled him with a profound sense of dread and despair. The cheeses that had once adorned his kitchen shelves now mocked him from their confinement, taunting him with their forbidden allure.\n\nAs days turned into weeks, Oliver found himself ensnared in the suffocating grip of depression. His once-vibrant spirit withered like a flower deprived of sunlight, leaving behind only the hollow shell of a man consumed by sorrow. The laughter that had once filled his home now echoed off its walls, a haunting reminder of happier times long since past.\n\nDesperate to escape the torment of his own mind, Oliver withdrew from the world around him, retreating into the solace of solitude. His friends and family, though well-meaning in their efforts to offer support, found themselves powerless in the face of his relentless anguish. Each day became a battle for survival, a relentless struggle against the invisible chains that bound him to his suffering.\n\nAlone in the darkness of his room, Oliver wrestled with his demons, tormented by memories of a life that once brimmed with joy and vitality. He longed to reclaim the simple pleasures that had once brought him so much happiness, but the specter of cheese loomed over him like a shadow, casting a pall of despair over his every waking moment.\n\nAnd so, on a cold, moonless night, Oliver made a decision that would irrevocably alter the course of his fate. With tears streaming down his face, he fashioned a makeshift noose from a length of frayed rope and ascended to the rafters of his attic. With each step, the weight of his despair bore down upon him, threatening to crush him beneath its unbearable burden.\n\nIn the silence of the night, Oliver's life came to a tragic end. His body swung gently from the rafters, a silent testament to the cruel whims of fate. And as the town mourned the loss of their beloved cheese aficionado, they were left to ponder the fragility of cheese and the devastating power of a passion turned sour.\n\n* Neko\\_998\n* \\_Wishbone22\n* ChatGPT",
