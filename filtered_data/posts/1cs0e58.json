    "selftext": "Or should I ask, would you prefer a carbon based therapist, or are you not that picky as long as it gets the job done.\n\nI am really curious about your thoughts about this topic.\n\nI am experiencing constant exhaustion through of all day, and I really can't give myself to my responsibilities that aren't actually that hard. My day consists of reading interesting topics on internet and listening song along with it. It gets so compulsive to a point that I can't even make myself eat what is just in front of me, while literally starving.\n\nI was going to start working with a local therapist, and I really liked her style on Instagram. But the thing is, session's frequency is once in a week and one session's cost is a little high than 45$ (which is a little fortune for my country) and I thought I can maybe use ChatGPT 4o with videocall feature instead of it. Of course I am going to subscribe to Plus. I mean, I would love to just spending 20$ per month instead of 45$ per week. By the way, for clearer understanding, therapy sessions with a human makes 180$ in a month, in contrast of 20$. Go figure that.\n\nWhich one should I go with? I also talked this with ChatGPT4o and I'm leaving the link to comments if you are interested with reading it.\n\nI will be looking forward for your comments!\n\n(Reddit's own filters are such a pain in the arse.)
