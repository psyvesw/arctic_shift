    "selftext": "This is a paranoid post, but my anxiety has been acting up a bit. With universities scrambling to to identify ChatGPT content, I was wondering if there could ever be a time in the future where universities could contact ChatGPT to access student accounts they believe have cheated, leading to universities seeing all correspondence and time stamps. I know this was an issue with Chegg so I was wondering if similar rules could apply? Also, if one day a database of all correspondence with ChatGPT will be available to plagiarism detectors and phrases from essays could be matched with it, similar to how plagiarism detectors scan the internet for identical phrasing now?  \n\n\nFor the record, I don't think I did anything wrong (???). I wrote a few essays myself and wanted someone to comment on them, so I put them into ChatGPT and asked it to grade them on a scale of 0-100 and provide potential feedback. The work was mine and I have drafts saved in google docs. I did ask for help rephrasing a few sentences for one essay but nothing was copy/pasted and even those sentences were further tweaked/edited. Genuinely did not know ChatGPT was frowned on for feedback/editing and just saw it as Grammarly on steroids. Since then, I have deleted my account and it says my data will be gone in 30 days, but I'm not sure if that's true. I also asked for feedback on non logged-in ChatGPT. I'm just really worried that one day chatgpt databases could be scanned and my essays would just be floating around and cause me to be accused of academic dishonesty years down the line.\n\nAnyway, is this a possibility? Would it even be legal? Can it retroactively impact us now? Sorry I'm paranoid and tired lol.",
