    "selftext": "I find that a lot of what's being discuss on most AI boards isn't as relevant to executives, and at best useful for AI enthusiasts and marketers (copy, images, etc).  \n  \nFrom my work with executives, it seems like most use ChatGPT mostly for emails - missing out on so much.\n\nAny cool ideas for execs, leaders, decision makers, mnagers, etc? \n\nHere are a bunch of things I use ChatGPT for: \n\n**1. Brainstorming with my heroes.** \n\nIf you're a CFO and want advice from the best CFO's in the world, look up some of your favorite public companies, look up their CFO's and you'll find that for most there's so much information out there ChatGPT is already trained on, which means it can surprisingly accurately give you advice as \"them\", if you asked it to. \n\nIs it like really having them in the room? Nope, but using a few of them to critique a strategy or an idea, can be extremely helpful. \n\n**2. Recruiting -** \n\nIf you're in HR and facing an issue of employee retention - ChatGPT can help you figure out the common denominators of your best employees, and then craft a wanted ad, or LinkedIn cold outreach sequence based on the psychological profile of those employees, and even help you focus on the right thing to look for.\n\nOf course if can also help you go through CV's to find the right people - when I recruit I'll often let it read up to 10 CV's and pick the winners based on the parameters I define, then when I have 3 winners, I ask it to create a table with pros of cons of each, and a comparison table between them. \n\nThe final decision is still mine, but I save TONS of time and \"brain power\" on trying to guess who would be the best recruit, and overall make better decisions in less time and effort.\n\n**3. Recruiting -** \n\nIf you're in HR and tasked with creating a hiring strategy, try asking ChatGPT about the strategy of companies known to be great at it, like Netflix or Disney. Then ask it to help you customize it, for exmaple \"help me make a version of this strategy that will work for a 60-person agrotech startup\". \n\nAgain, the result won't be useable in it's own, but will give you amazing ideas, and save you hours in brainstorming. \n\n---\n\nWould love to hear more things like these... anyone care to share?\n\n",
