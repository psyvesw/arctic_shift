    "selftext": "# I am from the Czech Republic. English is my second language. I've learned it a lot from the internet, because I've grown up on the internet and figured out very early that English language has way more content, therefore there's the motivation for learning it. I am 20 years old now.\n\n\n\nAs an kid and adolescent (8-18) my English vocabulary has always been way above average but my grammar was fairly average, because I never found motivation to \"want to learn it\" as I didn't see the point **why**.\n\nEven in my native language - Czech, I always had a problem with grammar and expressing my thoughts with words, whether spoken or written.\n\nHowever, I was a blind to that fact, until OpenAI Codex, GPT-3 and ChatGPT released 2 years ago. \n\nI was trying to get a certain goal from the AI, for example with Codex, for it to write me a code to do a certain thing. Very often I formulated the sentence in a way, that made the network think, I was awaiting a different response, than I actually did. (even though the AI was often just dumb)  \n  \nBecause I instantly saw that the AI misunderstood me, it made me have to edit the prompt, to be more clear and concise. (Often even the concise prompts didn't make the AI understand)\n\nIt was the first time, that I realized that when I express myself verbally, in a written form, with my emotional reactions and behaviours to certain situations, that very often, the expression is misaligned with what I actually think.   \n  \nAs I was trying to edit my prompts for the AI for it to understand me better, it made me do the same for human relationships and I started editing my sentences, so they better express what I actually feel or want and therefore my ability to learn from experiencing interactions improved drastically.\n\n2 years later, now, I am thinking way more about how a person or AI will comprehend me after I will feed him with an input of language or even *BEHAVIOURS.*\n\nThanks to this realization, my human relationships improved drastically. Before then, I was really isolated and often many people misunderstood me.\n\nLanguage models can serve as a trainer for thinking. Without fearing any negative response, more freedom for you to interact.\n\nPrompt engineering is much like social engineering or even user experience.\n\n  \nYou give the creature (human, neural network, animal) an input and you will always receive output. (if you are a boring person and you get ignored, getting ignored is still an output)\n\nThis can be even applied to your own conscious thinking. You are the conscious mind and your objective is to prompt engineer your unconscious mind to do what you want. (From my experience those two are often very misaligned XD)\n\nIf you are unhappy with the output, you can always change the input!\n\n",
