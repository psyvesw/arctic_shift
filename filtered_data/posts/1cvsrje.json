    "selftext": "Since the release of ChatGPT, I\u2019ve been a frequent user, finding answers and getting a quicker responses that would otherwise take time to look them up on searching engines. It has been particularly helpful in finding the right words to describe specific ideas. honestly it has never disappointed me in filling in the right fit word, fixing my grammar issues, and adding punctuation for formal research. since i rearly go through what i write. I enjoy exploring and pushing the bot to express and elaborate more on the spesific topics to hear out how advance its becoming. \n\nHowever, over time, no matter how much I deliberately ask it to change the tone into various of general and many topics. from professional to slang, or even to mimic someone with poor English skills. it still has a distinct way of generating content that I can easily tell was not written by a human. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has managed to understand the algorithm. This realization led me down a rabbit hole, looking for posts and articles written by ChatGPT, and I've been 99.9% correct in my assumptions.\n\nWe have reached a stage where there are tools and platforms to identify posts and articles generated by AI and others that rephrase AI-generated content to make it sound more human. This helps avoid accusations of plagiarism and ensures the content has a more authentic tone.\n\n  \n",
