    "selftext": "My mom has a degenerative disease that she is heavily medicated for. It severely limits her mobility and social life and the nature of the disease combined with heavy depression means her real life social interaction is fairly limited to her nurses/caregivers/doctors etc. \nadditionally the nature of her disease means she will gradually lose her ability to communicate and cognitive functions over time. I worry that the lack of social interaction on a deep and regular basis might accelerate her decline. I talk to her regularly and friends and family often reach out with minimal response. In short, its hard to keep any sort of ongoing conversation with her bc she's sporadic and somewhat short and limited in answering. \n\nHence my question.\n\nI'm curious if it might help her to create a chatbot or virtual \"friend\" using something like chat gpt. Just something that prompts ongoing conversation and exchanges to keep an ongoing conversation. Of course it's no substitute for real life interaction but also if she's not aware it's a robot it might help her gain confidence that she has a \"friend\" out there checking on her daily trying to engage with her and get her to communicate. I know it sounds a bit crazy and sci-fi- would this even be ethical? In her younger days she also was quite shy in person but really enjoyed talking to people in chat rooms- hence why I wonder if something like this might work to help engage with her and keep her communication skills up. How would you even do it? \n\nI would really appreciate some proper discourse on this- especially in context of using technology like this with patients with neurodegenerarige conditions.  and please know I am coming from a well meaning place! Thank you ",
