    "selftext": "I asked ChatGPT 4 to consider two passages from https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4784350.  The second passage was a conclusion, the first passage was an argument meant to support the conclusion.  ChatGPT 4 recognized the key inferential issue:  does the persuasive power of providing evidence undermine a decision-maker's discretion even when the system does not offer a final recommendation.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nPROMPT: Please consider the two passages below.  The first passage is cited approvingly in a paper, the second passage is from the conclusion of a section where the first passage appeared.  Do you think the first passage (a) supports the conclusion or (b) conflicts with it?\n\n  \n(1) Aybas\u2019s and Turkel\u2019s work...suggests that the more pieces of evidence an algorithm can provide to the officer, the more chances there are to persuade.139 And   \nthe more uncertain the officer is (e.g., the officer does not have other   \ninformation to look to or is not well-trained to conduct an independent   \ninvestigation), the more persuasive those pieces of evidence will be.\n\n  \n(2) To sum up, recommending evidence, citations, or other inputs to a final decision rather than \\[providing\\] a bottom-line decision \\[recommendation\\] is more likely to   \npreserve an officer\u2019s discretion, and is thus less likely to be an APA rule. One intuitive way to understand this argument is that such an algorithm would leave the adjudicator with several more reasoning steps between its output and a final decision.\n\nRESPONSE:  \n### \\*\\*Evaluating the Two Passages\\*\\*\n\n#### \\*\\*(1) Evidence from Aybas and Turkel\\*\\*\n\n- \\*\\*Description\\*\\*: The first passage suggests that algorithms can be persuasive, especially when they provide multiple pieces of evidence and the officer lacks other information or training.\n\n- \\*\\*Key Points\\*\\*: \n\n   - The more evidence the algorithm provides, the more persuasive it can be.\n\n   - This effect is stronger when the officer is uncertain or not well-trained.\n\n#### \\*\\*(2) The Conclusion\\*\\*\n\n- \\*\\*Description\\*\\*: The second passage argues that recommending evidence or inputs, rather than providing a bottom-line decision, is more likely to preserve an officer\u2019s discretion and not be considered an APA rule.\n\n- \\*\\*Key Points\\*\\*:\n\n   - Providing multiple inputs to an officer allows for more reasoning steps.\n\n   - This method is less likely to be viewed as a direct rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\n### \\*\\*Analysis\\*\\*\n\n- \\*\\*Conflict or Support?\\*\\*: \n\n   - The first passage supports the idea that providing more pieces of evidence increases persuasion, which aligns with the second passage's conclusion that multiple reasoning steps (inputs) preserve discretion.\n\n   - However, the first passage seems to imply that providing multiple pieces of evidence might inadvertently over-influence an officer, which could undermine discretion.\n\n   - Therefore, the first passage (a) \\*\\*supports\\*\\* the second passage's conclusion when the context is focused on preserving officer discretion through multiple inputs, but it also (b) \\*\\*conflicts\\*\\* slightly if we consider the potential over-persuasion of officers as a problem.\n\n### \\*\\*Conclusion\\*\\*\n\nOverall, the first passage primarily supports the conclusion of the second passage but raises a slight potential concern about over-persuasion. This should be monitored when preserving officer discretion is a priority.",
