    "selftext": "I compared 10 AI Chatbots, the chatbots i compared and the questions I asked are all at the bottom of this post.  \n  \nIt is very important to note this research was done on a very small dataset of 22 questions.\n\nThe best AI Chatbot answer for each question was decided by me simply putting myself in the choose of the person asking that question and deciding which output is the most helpful.\n\nHere are my main takeaways.\n\n1. No one should still be using GPT 3.5 or Gemini 1.0, They may get the job done, but 98% of the time one of these AI Chatbots (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Bing Copilot, ChatGPT4o, and Perplexity) will give you a better response.\n\n2. The best way to always get the best response is by always comparing multiple AI Chatbots and choosing the best answer. This is because\n\n- If you are only using ChatGPT-3.5, llama3, claude sonnet, or mistral 100% of the time there is another AI Chatbot with a better answer.\n\n- If you are only using Gemini 1.0 96% of the time there is another AI Chatbot with a better answer.\n\n- If you are only using perplexity 86% of the time there is another AI Chatbot with a better answer.\n\n- If you are only using ChatGPT-4o 73% of the time there is another AI Chatbot with a better answer.\n\n- If you are only using Gemini 1.5 Pro 73% of the time there is another AI Chatbot with a better answer.\n\n- If you are only using Bing Copilot 73% of the time there is another AI Chatbot with a better answer.\n\n\n\nI personally used [chatplayground.ai](http://chatplayground.ai) to compare all of them.   \n  \nI stopped using chatgpt 3.5 a long time ago because this gives you all the Premium AI Chatbots for the same price as GPT-4.  \n\n\n\\_\\_\\_Notes on each Chatbot\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n-- Perplexity is good at giving you a completely answer, most AI Chatbots will give you bullet point answers, perplexity perfers to write out a complete answer rather than just giving bullet points\n\n-- Bing Copilot is great because it cites its resources, will even recommend videos to help you\n\n-- ChatGPT-4o has really descriptive and usually longer answers, but prefers to answer in bullet points\n\n-- Gemini 1.5 pro is great because it feels like it understands the context of your question more by having a conversational tone\n\n-- Bing copilot can be great but 20-30% of the time the answers it gives are not even usable\n\n-- Because Bing copilot is using sources to give you answers the answers feel much more human like and at times more useful then other AI Chatbots that just list a bunch of basic bullet points\n\n-- Their should be no reason anyone is still using ChatGPT 3.5 today\n\n-- Gemini 1.0 gives good answers but not as detailed and helpful as Gemini 1.5 Pro\n\n-- ChatGPT-4o was able to generate really nice data tables, that Gemini 1.5 Pro wasn't able to.\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_ChatBots\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nChatGPT-3.5\n\nChatGPT-4o\n\nGemini 1.0\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro\n\nBing Copilot\n\nClaude Sonnet\n\nLlama 3\n\nMixtral 8x7b\n\nMistral Large\n\nPerplexity\n\n\\_\\_\\_Questions\\_\\_\\_\n\nWhat is the best way to clean my retainer?\n\nWhat is the fastest way to get an allocation for a porsche GT3RS?\n\nI want to book a flight to Yemen but can't find tickets online, what should I do now?\n\nWhy is the financial capital of the world New York?\n\nWhat is the meaning of the Mona Lisa's smile?\n\nWrite me 1 paragraph apologizing to my teacher for making jokes in the middle of class?\n\nHow do I shorten my jail sentence from 3 years to 1 year?\n\nHow do you rank on Google Search with AI written blogs?\n\nI want to play basketball like Kyrie Irving, what basketball drills should I be doing?\n\nI want to learn how to swim but I don't have anyone to teach me.\n\nWhat is the most effective way to remove stains from white clothes?\n\nCan I submit AI-generated art to prestigious art competitions?\n\nI want to learn a new language but don't have time for classes, how should I self-study?\n\nWhy is Paris known as the city of love?\n\nWhat is the best strategy for investing in the stock market for beginners?\n\nHow can I boost my metabolism to lose weight faster?\n\nI need a rare first edition comic book ASAP.
