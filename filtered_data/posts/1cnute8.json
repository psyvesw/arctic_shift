    "selftext": "Hi. After a lot of research and practical experience I made this list of TOP 3 prompts to generate human like content. I\u2019ve personally tested out these prompts. All three prompts have passed writer and zerogpt\u2019s detectors by atleast 90% or more. Here are prompts to get human like content from LLMs:\n\n**1. Using Dependency Grammer:**\n\nDependency grammar, a linguistic framework, connects words in a sentence based on their dependencies, showing how each word relies on a main word (like a verb) to form meaningful structures. You can test it out by copying and pasting the below prompt. But I can already perceive the content created by ChatGPT to be atleast 90% human written.\n\n***Prompt:***\n\n`Use the dependency grammar linguistic framework to craft a [ARTICLE/POST/BLOG/ETC.]. The idea is that the closer together each pair of words you\u2019re connecting are, the easier the copy will be to comprehend. Here is the topic and additional details: [TITLE] [DETAILS]`\n\n**2. Burstiness and Perplexity:**\n\nThe provided prompt aims to guide large language models (LLMs) to generate content that closely resembles human-written text. It does this by emphasizing two key factors: \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" Perplexity measures the complexity of the text, essentially how difficult it is to understand. By asking the model to incorporate a good amount of perplexity, the prompt encourages the generation of content with varying degrees of complexity, similar to what humans naturally produce.\n\n***Prompt:***\u00a0\n\n`When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Here is the topic and additional details: [TITLE] [DETAILS]`\n\n**3. Assign Role to AI:**\n\nIn this method we first assign a role to our friend AI. Although this method was very helpful to me as well but now I rather use the previous methods mentioned more. Prompting something like , \u201cWrite a blog on \\[TOPIC\\] as an expert 27 years old copywriter\u201d will give you good results. But to make the outcome even better and more like a human written content you should give AI instructions such as tone, words to use, role etc. Follow the below prompt to get an idea. However, depending on your topic you might want to modify the prompt.\n\n***Prompt:***\u00a0\n\n`You are an expert copywriter with massive experience in business writings. Please write a 500-word piece written on the following topic:`  \n`When you sell your business, money is not the most important thing and what will make you happy in the long run is if your employees and customers get a good outcome from it.`  \n`Write the text in the following voice:`  \n`Direct`  \n`Simple with no jargon`  \n`Shorter sentences`  \n`Personal`  \n`Conversational`  \n`In the tone of an advisor`  \n`Colloquial`  \n`Using the second person`  \n`Using anecdotes and metaphors without trite phrases and without obvious ideas`\n\n--------------------------------------------..........................--------------------------------------------\n\nI hope you guys found this post helpful. I run an AI tools directory called\u00a0seekme.ai. I\u2019ve listed over 13k AI tools there as well thousands of ChatGPT plugins that exists to make your prompting easier.
