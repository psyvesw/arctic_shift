    "selftext": "After seeing the Open AI presentation with AI looking at the page and assuming a teacher role, with custom tailored approach, infinite patience and ability to teach at the most appropriate pace, how is it going to be justifiable to have kids sit in a school half a day to listen to a teacher? Teacher does not have time or ability to understand perfectly what each of their students understands and spend time with each student one on one.\n\nIt just seems that with this version or at least the next version, kids can now learn actively within few hours what they can learn in a school passively in a week. Probably even more due to fact that AI can absolutely make sure they understand the topic and the kid does not have to be worried asking 10 times same thing to not feel stupid ( which is major problem in current education system ).\n\nI am just wondering how is it justifiable to force kids spend half their childhood sitting behind a desk, when they can learn same stuf on their own probably in about 20% of the time. Only point of school I can see is for kids to socialize, talk about what they learned and get tested on what they learned. I truly hope this marks end of the days where kids have to passively sit and listen for 6 hours every day to just forget 90% of it anyway.",
