    "selftext": "I saw a video that said that certain AIs were predicting the end of the world on this day, so I decided to keep asking to see if anything would happen, and after around  5 normal-like responses (an example is linked below), it said this.\n\nCould anyone explain it?\n\nExample of an average answer: \n\nPredicting specific events on a particular date in the future, like July 12, 2036, is highly speculative. However, here are a few general possibilities based on current trends and potential future developments:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Technological Advances\\*\\*: By 2036, we might see significant advancements in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, and renewable energy. AI could become even more integrated into daily life, potentially impacting various sectors such as healthcare, transportation, and education.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Climate Change Impact\\*\\*: Efforts to mitigate climate change will be crucial. Depending on global actions taken in the next decade, we could see significant shifts in climate patterns, with increased efforts towards sustainability and green energy.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Space Exploration\\*\\*: Human space exploration might reach new milestones. Mars missions could be underway, and there might be more established bases on the Moon, along with advancements in space tourism.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Global Politics and Economy\\*\\*: The geopolitical landscape could undergo significant changes. Emerging economies might rise, and new alliances could form. The global economy might see shifts due to technological innovations and changing trade dynamics.\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Healthcare Advances\\*\\*: Medical technology and treatments could improve drastically. Personalized medicine, advanced genetic therapies, and possibly even cures for certain diseases might become available.\n\n\n\n6. \\*\\*Cultural and Social Changes\\*\\*: Societal norms and cultural practices could evolve with changing technologies and global interactions. There might be new forms of entertainment, communication, and social structures.\n\n\n\nThese are broad predictions based on current trajectories and technological, social, and environmental trends. Specific events on a particular day like July 12, 2036, remain unpredictable.\n\n",
