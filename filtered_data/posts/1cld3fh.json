    "selftext": "Hi. So as the title of this post says, I am trying to learn french by using chatgpt. Its a really great experience. But I am facing one issue. I haven't been able to prompt it to respond to me like this\u00a0**always**\u00a0during our conversation: first correct whatever I have said or written, and then respond to my original query or question.\n\nIt can very well explain grammatical or vocabulary errors if I ask it separately. But I cant incorporate this logic into a single conversation so that\u00a0**each time**\u00a0I say something or write something it first corrects whatever I have said or written and then respond. It also happens that often it starts following this logic for some messages and then discards it later on. Also, I tried the language teacher custom GPT as well. It does have this feature by default that it first corrects our sentences/words and then responds. But even this bot seems to abandon this habit later on during the conversation.\n\nI tried subscribing to GPT4 as well for this but that also does not always work like how i intend. I am pretty sure this can be done easily but haven't been able to figure it out.\n\nAs you might be able to imagine, I try to have long conversations with the bot through my phone to improve my verbal communication. And having this feature unlocked would greatly improve my learning.\n\nThanks in advance for your responses.",
