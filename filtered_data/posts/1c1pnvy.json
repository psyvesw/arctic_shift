    "selftext": "I love NSFW role playing. With a good partner, it\u2019s essentially like reading a good erotic novel, but that can be tweaked to your liking. But it\u2019s difficult to find a chat partner who not only matches my kinks and interests, but is a good writer **and** who has a matching schedule. \n\nI recently got a crash course in ChatGPT 4, and the feature where it can create your own \u201ccustom\u201d ChatGPT. I immediately thought about using it to create an AI role playing partner.\n\nBut, as far as I know, the rules don\u2019t allow it, and it\u2019s likely to get flagged and eventually get me banned. \n\nIs there any NSFW friendly/agnostic service or software out there that can match ChatGPT 4 and this \u201ccustom\u201d ChatGPT feature?\n\nI would like to be able to upload large chat session logs, where the AI can understand the two roles played, and I then can assign it one character and it would only play that character and never try to write for my character. And it should mimic the writing style, temper, meanness etc of the character in the cgat session logs.\n\nAnd preferably I would like it to understand \u201cin character\u201d and \u201cout of character\u201d, where I can give instructions or guidance while out if character (and it must follow that), while it should not treat what I wrote **IN** character as instructions. Because my character is often a victim, and might beg and plead for mercy etc. But the character played by the AI will me mean and uncaring, and ignore my pleads. \n\nAnd I guess that I should mention that my role playing usually leans towards the dark/heavy content (ie non-consensual and more). \n\nIs there anything out there that can achieve this?
