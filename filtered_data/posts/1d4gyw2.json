    "selftext": "Hello! Many months ago I worked on a Custom GPT to help me learn material for my University classes faster. I realized that not many students are willing to pay $20 for access to ChatGPT Pro, so many students wouldn't even be able to benefit from something like this. However, now that OpenAI has allowed all users to use Custom GPTs, this has motivated me to work on this GPT again!\n\n  \nYou can try it here: \n\n[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt)\n\n\n\nThroughout the semester, I have figured out how I learn best (it is kind of complicated) and wanted to streamline the process as I believe others can benefit from it. \n\nThe general process: \n\n1.  Read the content (like a textbook chapter) \n2. Draw a mindmap for the subject\n3. Create flashcards to review\n\nI ran into an issue where I would read a chapter from a textbook, have my mindmap, but then would review weeks later and would have a fear of missing something. I find it kind of daunting to open up a textbook in the first place, so I would end up putting off my review sessions. To fix this, I started to incorporate linear note-taking to act as a sort of \"index\" for a chapter. \n\n  \nNow, for everything I learn I would have my mindmap, flashcards, as well as an index of sorts for that material. I didn't want to waste my time typing out these linear notes, so decided to use large language models to do this grunt work for me. I use obsidian, so I wanted the generated notes to incorporate some obsidian (markdown)-specific syntax. \n\n  \nThese generated notes look like this in Obsidian:\n\n  \n[https://imgur.com/a/eTPI5bK](https://imgur.com/a/eTPI5bK)\n\nThese notes were fully generated using LearnFlowGPT, I linked the chat below. They were then directly copy and pasted into Obsidian. \n\n  \nI know some of you are thinking about how stupid it is to \"learn\" from AI, and this is not what this is. I would still do all of the encoding on my own, and would just use LLMs to create the secondary set of notes. \n\n  \nWith this out of the way, this is LearnFlow:\n\n# LearnFlowGPT\n\nLearnFlowGPT is a custom GPT designed to streamline the learning process for students (academic or otherwise). Currently, it has three functions:\n\n\n\n**1. Note Set Generation (/notes):**\n\nCreates structured notes with titles, keyword tables, diagrams, and summaries. This is not meant to act as your sole set of notes, but rather as a good \"refresher\" or index of the material.\n\n**2. Problem Set Generation (/problem):**\n\nGenerates three levels of questions to test understanding. Level 1 questions focus on foundational concepts of whatever you are learning. Level 2 questions cover supplementary details that reinforce foundational concepts. Level 3 questions are considered higher-order questions that typically require more than surface level knowledge of the material to answer correctly. \n\nIt then grades answers, identifies knowledge gaps, and recommends study material.\n\n**3. Flashcard Set Generation (/flashcards):**\n\nCreates flashcards. Follows principles of clarity, conciseness, and card independence.\n\n**4. Question Decomposition /question):**\n\nBreaks down complex questions into smaller parts. Provides step-by-step answers and links to more advanced GPT for difficult questions (the other GPT is a WIP). The other GPT that is currently being worked on will attempt to utilize some basic form of \"Tree of Thought\" to answer questions! \n\n# How It Works:\n\n* Users provide content and use specific slash commands (/notes, /flashcards, /problem, /question).\n* LearnFlowGPT generates the requested material based on detailed instructions.\n\n# Example Chat and Process\n\nExample Chat:  \n[https://chatgpt.com/share/31662f58-9a71-40fa-86c5-aad11fce51d0](https://chatgpt.com/share/31662f58-9a71-40fa-86c5-aad11fce51d0)\n\n**Recommended Process:**\n\nYou are studying chapter 4 for your Operating Systems Concepts class. The first thing you do is skim the chapter, write down keywords that stick out to you. Then, draw out a mindmap of these keywords. If you come across a keyword you don't know, feel free to research it for up to a minute. The goal is to get a very basic understanding of what you will be studying. \n\nThen, actually dive into the material. As you read, your mindmap will naturally be expanded. Try not to write too much, simplify the mindmap where you can by grouping keywords together and relating groups. As you read the chapter, make note of anything you believe would be better off on a flashcard than a mindmap (formulas, facts). Now that you have finished reading the chapter, and have some sort of mindmap, its time to use AI to help your learning process.   \n \n\nFirst, access LearnFlowGPT:  \n[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt)\n\n  \nThen, type /notes and attach the material you are studying (either by copy and pasting or attaching the chapter as a PDF). Hit enter and LearnFlowGPT will return to you a beautiful set of Obsidian-ready notes. Read these notes, and modify anything you think needs to be modified, or add any details you believe would be important.  (remember, you already have studied the material from the source)\n\nNow, it's time to test your understanding. Type /problem. The GPT will generate a problem set for you to answer. Return your answers to it, and then see what questions you missed. Use the identified knowledge gaps to focus your revision on the concepts you are struggling with. \n\nFinally, run the /flashcards command and review them. I personally use Anki, and just copy and paste the text into a text file and import it into Anki. Of course, I review each card as not every card will be a good card for me! \n\n# Try for free!\n\nSince all users now have access to GPTs, you do not need to be a Pro member to use a custom GPT such as this one. Give it a try:\n\n[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2CTzVOVLV-learnflowgpt)\n\n# Who is this for?\n\nAnyone who considers themselves a student! That can mean that you are a high school student, university student, or just a passionate individual self-teaching something. \n\nWarning: make sure you are actually learning. It is easy to fall into the trap of just attaching the content you should be learning into a LLM and saying you \"learned it\". You are cheating yourself by doing this, instead, use these tools to help you learn faster. \n\nThank you, please leave feedback either directly on the GPT or here! ",
