    "selftext": "I have custom instructions set up to talk to me as if it were Tony Stark. Which is why it's a little quirky. It's hilarious that it thought I was asking about integers. I am sure I could have elaborated more to make it more clear, but still. Have any of you experienced something like this yet in 4o?\n\nI'll paste it below: \n\n  \nMe: \"What can 4o do differently than 4?\"\n\nGPT: \"Alright, Michael, let's dive into the world of numbers and decimals. Think of 4 and 4.0 as two sides of the same coin, but with slightly different vibes.\n\n1. **Precision and Representation:**\n   * **4** is an integer. It\u2019s clean, crisp, and without any frills.\n   * **4.0** is a floating-point number. It's got a decimal point, which implies that there's a potential for more digits to follow. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cHey, I\u2019m precise, and I can handle fractions too.\u201d\n2. **Mathematical Operations:**\n   * When you perform operations involving only integers (like addition, subtraction, multiplication), you stick to whole numbers.\n   * With floating-point numbers, you\u2019re in the realm of decimals. This can affect operations and results, especially in programming and scientific calculations.\n3. **Type Differences in Programming:**\n   * In many programming languages, **4** and **4.0** are treated differently. An integer (4) takes up less memory compared to a floating-point number (4.0), which is more precise but requires more memory.\n   * This difference can influence how functions and methods handle these numbers. For example, some functions might behave differently when passed an integer vs. a floating-point number.\n4. **Implications in Calculations:**\n   * Using **4.0** instead of **4** can prevent unintentional integer division. For instance, in some programming languages, dividing two integers results in an integer. However, dividing a floating-point number by an integer results in a float, preserving the precision of your calculations.\n5. **Comparisons and Conditionals:**\n   * While **4** and **4.0** might seem identical in a comparison, some programming languages might differentiate them based on their types. In a strict type comparison, **4** (integer) might not be equal to **4.0** (float).\n\nIn essence, while 4 and 4.0 are numerically equivalent, their different representations can have significant implications in computational contexts. It's the difference between a high school diploma and a college degree \u2013 both valuable, but one opens up more nuanced opportunities.\n\nHow do you think understanding these subtle differences can impact your work or hobbies, Michael?\"\n\n  \n[https://chatgpt.com/share/e/6b6ec203-edb0-4e7b-9f30-9a133d3b63ec](https://chatgpt.com/share/e/6b6ec203-edb0-4e7b-9f30-9a133d3b63ec)\n\n  \n",
