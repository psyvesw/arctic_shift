    "selftext": "Been using GPT-3.5 around a year. I've a free account and recently got offered a trial on GPT-4o, and of course I accepted! It does a few requests (maybe 10?) as GPT-4o and then it reverts to use GPT-3.5 until my limit resets after 6 hrs.  \n  \nI get that this is an upgrade and I can tell it is vastly superior to the previous version, but I actually prefer 3.5. There is something about 4o - it is great and completes requests accurately and does a lot more in terms of layout clarity, organising ideas etc and seems to understand the request better, but somehow the responses don't have the same charm as 3.5. Maybe I am just used to using 3.5 though, so am interested to hear others' opinions.\n\nSomehow 3.5 felt like a tool, an assistant to give specific requests and it would just churn them out very quickly and precisely. 4o to me is a lot more 'human' I suppose, and it conveys things with a sort of sassiness that 3.5 hinted at in a fun way but 4o is kind of too smart? I feel like a mere mortal in its presence, whereas 3.5 felt like my friendly helper. And makes me question as it goes more this way as it gets 'smarter' and 'better', GPT-5 and beyond, will it just get fed up of replying to morons like me? Can I just stay on 3.5?",
