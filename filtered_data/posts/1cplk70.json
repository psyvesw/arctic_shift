    "selftext": "So I wanted to create a custom GPT, so I started by adding a bunch of PDFs to its knowledge. I quickly discovered I was limited to only 10 files. Okay, a bit annoying, but no biggie, after all, I could extract all the data in plain text and just give it more knowledge. \n\nHowever, as I was tweaking it I became frustrated that it wasn\u2019t checking the knowledge files, despite specific instructions to do so. I basically had to mention in every single prompt to check the docs. And as I was tweaking it, it hit me with the following error:\n\n> You\u2019ve reached the current usage cap for GPT-4, please try again after\u2026\n\nThere was a link that said Learn more, but was just a form called \u201cHigher usage caps for GPT-4\u201d which I was supposed to fill out telling them why I needed higher usage limits. \n\nWhat. The. Fuck?!\n\nThere wad no mention of any usage limits when I signed up for the paid subscription. Furthermore I could not find out any way what this limit is and how much of it I used. The only limits I could find were for API requests, but I\u2019m not using the API. \n\nI feel like I was taken for a ride. I signed up for the chatGPT Plus specifically thinking that I was going to use chatGPT 4 and custom GPTs for my specific use cases, but if I\u2019m going to get limited after just a dozen or so questions, it\u2019s useless\u2026",
