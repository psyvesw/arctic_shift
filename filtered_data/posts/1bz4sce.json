    "selftext": "Before an update at some point roughly a month ago, it was ok-ish (mainly writing simple snippets, parsing jsons, models etc. boring stuff).  \n\n\nOf course worse than january 2024 not mentiong gpt3 from december 2022, but better than free self-hosted model with RTX4090.  \n\n\nSince March is utterly stupid, moronic, lying, without any kind of context memory.  \n\n\nIt can completely write something moronic ignoric what was said/context that was 2 sentences before.  \n\n\nIt was never that bad, somewhere in Februrary it stopped remembering content from other chat (it seemed was beta?) as I was able to ask if he remembers what we were writing about specific use case. He did.   \n\n\nNow he won't remember something 1000 words before....  \n\n\nAlso keeps throwing tons of crap that is repetitive (like description of some irrelevant stuff).  \n\n\nHe can spam me like 300-500 words about the same thing over and over and at the bottom add 5 lines of a code...  \n\n\nSuper annoying and time wastefull.  \n\n\nIs is just UK instances or perhaps I was too much cursing on that thing and they've put me on ChatGPT 1 Alpha ?  \n\n\nIt is definitely worse than what I get from other free models running on my rtx4090 when we focus on context/intelligence. Unfortunately the UI is bad and have to look for another working UI.  \n\n\nI was cancelling this service perhaps 6-7 times at each regress in quality.  \n\n\nNow almost any free service is better.  \n\n\nI have tested image quality in February, it was ok... Now? It looks like garbage free model that can run on GTX1660...   \n\n\nBut then I see some other people that love it and can generate nice stuff (I am using MidJourney for that so it is not impressive to me as MidJourney quality is blowing out of water stupidGPT4).  \n\n\n  \nWhat is going on? Of course Claude is also blowing out of the water semi-intelligent-GPT1.5 that is being sold as GPT4, however they cannot handle the load currently (many new users ditching scamGPT4)",
