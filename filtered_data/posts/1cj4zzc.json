    "selftext": "I'm frustrated because I wrote a fairly elaborate post and it didn't submit, so I'll just keep it brief now. \n\nI love the mobile verbal model, it's extremely versatile and colloquially beyond impressive. Yeah I know it can do a lot more, but I love science and tech and I like challenging it, it's almost always impressing me, I get so amused by how it handles things sometimes. \n\nIt seems OpenAI is having to catch up with their increase in traffic and popularity. \n\nI am not satisfied with theessage cap I get as a paid user. Especially because the only difference is speech recognition SW. I'm almost positive because unless I imply it, or inquire about the topic, it doesn't even seem to be aware that we are vocally communicating. \n\nFree users make up most of their data intake, that's understandable and respectable. Of course you don't wanna sacrifice your larger user base to the point of loss in user activity just to prioritize a small percentage of users. I get it. But then what the fuck am I paying for? I know on paper the features that I'm paying for, I've used them in a couple of occasions, but am I really paying 20 bucks a month to be limited to... Like.... 25 interactions within a conversation?? \n\nAs I said I get everything, I can rationalize reasons, but I'm about ready to stop paying then, when they could have instead slightly throttled free users as an incentive to meet the demand. I'm not a software engineer, so 80% of the paid model is wasted on me. \n\nThoughts?",
