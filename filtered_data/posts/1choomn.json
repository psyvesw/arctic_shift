    "selftext": "I\u2019ll try to keep this short. I messed up. I used AI to write my term paper. Obviously, I revised it many times and only really used it to gather ideas. Regardless, I still used it. I put it through multiple checkers and it came up as 0% AI, but the version history is still visible and you can see how many drafts I made - including an AI term paper that I accidentally pasted from another class. I\u2019ve used it before to help with other essays for this class/professor before, but for some reason because of version history and potential lack of proper citations, Im scared I will be reprimanded. Honest to God, this is the first instance I\u2019ve ever done anything like this and the only reason I did it was because I\u2019ve changed to a different major after realizing my heart was into my current major, and overall, had little to no steam to complete this essay and i would\u2019ve dropped the classes, but it was too late. So instead of risking failing (which I probably would\u2019ve done anyway, regardless if I turned in this assignment or not) I decided to \u2018cheat\u2019. Now I\u2019m afraid I will be caught and reprimanded. I have another essay for the same professor (different class) that is overdue that I was going to use AI to help me write, but after confronting these feelings, I feel like it\u2019s just better to take the L and fail the class as the essay is already overdue. I feel morally bad as well, but I\u2019m really concerned that I will be caught. It\u2019s sucks bc I didn\u2019t even want to be in the class and would\u2019ve dropped it if I could by this point. I know I fucked up, but any advice or assurance would be appreciated. I\u2019m just hoping this won\u2019t get me kicked out of school for a class that didn\u2019t even matter towards my degree. ",
