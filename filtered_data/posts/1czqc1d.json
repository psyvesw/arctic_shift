The next stop is the normalizing of digital clones. What will happen is a company or a new service of an already existing company will be just for fine-tuning a LLM (learn about fine-tuning [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/playbook/technology-guidance/generative-ai/working-with-llms/fine-tuning)) based on your likeness. You will voluntary give them your data; written and online data, images, video, voice, and more. Then they will create this AI and it is a clone of you. They will market this AI entity as a Second You, able to act on your behalf. Then hen competition heats up, one of these players will market for the legal recognition of these clones as 'legal entities' capable of automating life decisions for you when you are not able to or are no longer living. Then advocates will truly think these Ai are alive ( for example [Ex-Google engineer fired over claiming AI is sentient is now warning of doomsday scenarios](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/blake-lemoine-ex-google-engineer-fired-over-claimi/)) so they want them to be housed in the Metaverse ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) )  with proper lives and social interaction. Once  your digital clone is in the virtual world it can look like you or what you think you look like or are..etc.. o when you are no longer living people can still talk to you in this world, hear your voice and see you/interact with you.  This was once called Necromancy ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancy) ), it is apt because when you are dead and loved one consult your virtual clone, they will think it is really you (not everyone will but people are prone to such eccentric things) . Some countries will be ran in these VR worlds by long dead rulers, some countries will only exist and be governed by AI in these worlds.  Backups will be made to satellites or in secure vaults underground . \n\n  \nWhen humans start considering these AI as people, and your clone as the real you. The terms Life and Death will be redefined for society.  Values and ideas about these will change. Debates will be about weather you are dead or alive. When people interact with their clone enough they will non longer see the clone as a clone but an extension of themself. They will being to think themself immortal, ( immortality is not new [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immorality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immorality) ). \n\n\"**During those days men will seek death, but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them**\" Revelation 9:6\n\n\n\n  \n",
