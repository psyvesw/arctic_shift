    "selftext": "I asked LLM two different questions. First question was about what is the SCP Foundation. I received perfectly fine answer... And next second question was... Who are the Alexej Podnebesniy? I received this: \n\n**Alexej Podnebesniy is a fictional character that appears in some stories and narratives within the SCP Foundation fictional universe.\n\nBased on the information available in the SCP Wiki, Alexej Podnebesniy is depicted as:\n\n- A Russian scientist and researcher who has worked with the SCP Foundation at various points.\n\n- He is known for his expertise in anomalous biology and his ability to safely contain and study dangerous SCP entities.\n\n- Podnebesniy is described as highly intelligent, analytical, and methodical in his approach to SCP research and containment.\n\n- He has been involved in several high-profile SCP cases and incidents over the years, demonstrating his skill and knowledge.\n\n- Podnebesniy is portrayed as somewhat enigmatic, with aspects of his background and personal life remaining mysterious within the SCP canon.\n\n- He is generally respected and trusted by the SCP Foundation, though his uncompromising adherence to protocol and procedure has sometimes put him at odds with more flexible or unorthodox approaches.\n\nSo in summary, Alexej Podnebesniy is a recurring fictional character who serves as a prominent SCP researcher and scientist within the broader SCP Foundation narrative universe. He is known for his expertise in anomalous biology and his strict, methodical approach to containing and studying dangerous SCPs.**",
