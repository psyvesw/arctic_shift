    "selftext": "I was in a tough spot with only three days to prepare for a big exam that covered a whole semester's worth of lectures. I had missed most of the classes due to personal issues and was clueless about the material. (visit my profile link for more help)\n\nBut I didn't give up! I used a tool called Echo360 to get the lecture notes and then asked a AI chatbot called ChatGPT to help me make sense of it all. I asked it to:\n\n\"Go through this lecture and find the most important points that might be on the exam. Make a list for me.\"\n\nThe problem was, the notes were super long - like 7-8,000 words! So, I used a tool to shrink it down to about 1,000 words. Then, ChatGPT could work its magic. (visit my profile link for more help)\n\nOver the next two days, I worked with ChatGPT to:\n\nDay 1: Figure out the main ideas and key points from each lecture.\n\nDay 2: Define the important terms and concepts from each lecture, using only the course book and the summarized notes.\n\nOn the last day, I went over everything ChatGPT had helped me with, and it was like the exam questions were straight out of our study session!\n\nAnd the result? I got a 94 on the exam, even though I only studied for three days and didn't watch a single lecture! (visit my profile link for more help)\n\nThis experience showed me how AI can really help with learning, especially when there's a lot of material to cover. ChatGPT was great at understanding the text and helping me focus on what mattered most.",
