    "selftext": "Forgive my post if I am being naive or don't understand the features of ChatGPT 4o, but I was a little taken aback tonight when I described myself as \"left-wing\" and the chat indicated it was \"updating memory.\" I asked, \"out of curiosity, what are you updating?\" And it said, \"that you \\[First Name\\], are left-wing.\" I asked why and it replied\n\n\"I updated my memory with that detail because it seemed relevant to understanding your perspective and preferences, especially since political views can influence how you interpret theories and ideas. This helps me provide more contextually tailored responses in future conversations. If you'd prefer I didn't remember specific details like that, just let me know!\"\n\nI asked if this information would inform its responses in conversations outside of this ongoing one, and it confirmed, yes. I then asked it to reveal what information it had about me...was pretty surprised to see like a 15-item list, including info about a minor medical condition, etc. that I was trying to learn more about. \n\nThe political leaning thing wasn't that concerning to me, tbh, but the fact that it was retaining all this info about my medical history left me feeling a little weird. That being said, I simply had to ask ChatGPT to \"forget\" this info, and it claims that it has. But, just as an advisory, if you're playing around with the new version, it might be worth just straight up asking what it knows about you. \n\nI know I should technically share a link to the chat, but as it contains personal info about me, I feel a little iffy about it. Sorry if that goes against the rules of the sub. ",
