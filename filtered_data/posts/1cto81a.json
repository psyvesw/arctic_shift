    "selftext": "Looking for a good alternative to chatgpt or Bing since anything violent or sexual (even for educational questions) will trigger flag and refuse to answer. I came across freedomgpt. They will give you some credit for first account and after asking few NSFW questions I decide to buy the 10$ pack. enough for lot of questions. So you might be asking. What is the problem? \n\n-The problem is the answers are no all \"liberty\" as they say, anything out of ordinary will trigger its flag and refuse to answer or give you some PG13 answer. \n\n-Credits will expire after 30 days. Yes even if you spend 50 dollars and forgot about it. Welp you'll have shit next time you come back\n\n-Lastly and I think the worst is the response cap. Ok I can deal with the PG13 response or even the credits period. The worst is that after you ask you questions it will give you a stupid answer then IT WILL ASK YOU TO PAY TO CONTINUE WRITING. And that is how they drain all you credits. And you might be thinking well maybe the answer is long. for the price you are paying you expect at least 1 page long but no, is always one paragraph and that's all then you have to pay if you want more and pay again and again if you want longer and so on.\n\nThe regular chatgpt is way better than this. Stay out \n",
