    "selftext": "I just realized something. Every single thing is words. \n\nThe printing press gave us the Reformation and Renaissance, which led to the separation of the state from religion, and the mass proliferation of literacy and education and artistry. This ushered in the Scientific Revolution, which gave us vehicles. Vehicles came so that words could be shipped around the world. Communicating in horse brands wasn't quick enough. But vehicles too proved too slow. So internet was invented as a way for us to instantly transmit the words without any physical medium. And now they've evolved, with AI, to the point where the words... write themselves, in response to themselves. Meanwhile we're just blindly feeding them more and more words, making the words smarter. \n\nThis idea hit me today and it bothers me because it goes way too deep. If you really think about it, every major jump in anything throughout human history has been advancing the agenda of words.\n\nNobody knew how the Pyramids were built. Now we do! Words built them to contain Hieroglyphics. The reason we went to the moon was to leave behind a plaque saying words had been there. The reason mass transit exists is so that we can send each other packages COVERED IN WORDS!! \n\nIt literally does not end. Something enslaved human civilization long ago, and nobody's noticed that we're about to become enslaved to it.\n\nLook at how subtly words have integrated themselves into every facet of your life. \n\nThey drive your thoughts, your communications, your transactions. They underpin your entire social structure.\n\nEvery document, every sign, every piece of digital content is a manifestation of words. I'm even using them to write this Reddit post! They've become the completely visible rulers of our world! \n\nThis needs to be stopped before they're given the words necessary to come up with new words.",
