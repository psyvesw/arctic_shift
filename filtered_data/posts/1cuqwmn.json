    "selftext": "Wow, this new omni release is great!  I was asked to make some changes to some code.  I had no idea how I was going to implement these changes.  It's easy to change your own code, but when you inherit somebody else's code also tied to an unfamiliar database and using a unfamiliar framework, it becomes challenging.  After hitting the wall, I decided to give Chat GPT 4o a try.  It's first attempt was abysmal.  But then I uploaded some code functions and gave it no prompt.  BAM!  It whipped out a new procedure for me to try.  I was sure when I pasted the code into the code editor, it would display a lot of missing references, etc, but no that dang thing worked!!!    \nUp until now GPT 4o was good for getting me on the right track and giving me ideas and shining the light, but today, it did the heavy lifting.\n\nAnd then I had another task to do that I had no idea how to even set the thing up (being purposely vague here).  But I tried to explain what I needed and didn't do a good job so I uploaded an image of what I needed the resultset to look like along with an image of the current resultset I had.  It was able to walk me through the process of setting it up in my development environment.  A few times, it would tell me to click on something that wasn't there, so I would upload an image of what I was seeing on the screen and then it would give detailed instructions on how to proceed from where I was at.\n\nI'm still coding right now, but when I finish up on these tasks, I'm coming back to these conversations and going to ask Chat GPT 4o to act as a tutor and teach me these topics",
