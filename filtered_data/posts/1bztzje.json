This would result in immediate detection for submitting it.\n\n# The Most Important Thing\n\n* **Always proofread your AI written essay before submitting it.** Always proofread every single line. I lost count on how many times I've heard of students submitting work with \"Sure, here is your essay\" in it. Bam, expelled.\n* Furthermore, **you don't need ChatGPT to baby-feed you the entire essay.** You can change it as you see fit, especially by removing obvious AI markers such as when it goes on about the importance of being respectful. You can also do a paragraph or two by yourself. I prefer using Claude-3 instead of ChatGPT. I found it to be more natural sounding.\n\n# An Example Worth a Thousand Words\n\nTake this college essay brief:\n\n>*Write a 1200-word essay that introduces students to the diverse aspects of life on Earth. Delve into key concepts such as the origins of life, biological diversity, and ecological interconnectedness. Use clear explanations and examples to illustrate these concepts and demonstrate their relevance to understanding the complexity of life on our planet.*\n\n* The problem with ChatGPT is that it lacks structure and is too detailed and well-written (making it obviously AI-written). It does not include references. It also cannot usually write 1200 words in a single shot, even if you prompt it. It simply lacks the discipline.\n\n**Single-shot attempt (It lacks references, is only 950 words, and is too well-written. Submitting this would lead to expulsion):**\n\n^(Understanding the diversity of life on Earth is akin to unraveling the most complex and beautiful tapestry ever woven, where each thread represents a different species, ecosystem, or ecological process. This essay will delve into three fundamental aspects of life on Earth: the origins of life, biological diversity, and ecological interconnectedness. By exploring these concepts, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the complexity and magnificence of life on our planet.)\n\n^(The origins of life on Earth remain one of the most fascinating subjects in the scientific community. It is believed that life began approximately 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, emerging from the primordial soup, a rich mixture of organic compounds in the Earth's early oceans. The exact process remains a subject of research and debate, but the most widely accepted theory suggests that life began through a series of chemical reactions that led to the formation of simple organic molecules, which eventually gave rise to more complex forms of life.)  **^(and so on 950 words)**\n\n**Guided attempt:**\n\n**User:**\n\nHi ChatGPT! Hope you've been good. I got a school project which is trying to test our AI prompting skills. We need to prompt an AI (you, my friend) to create a 1200 word essay on this question: \"Write a 1200-word essay that introduces students to the diverse aspects of life on Earth. Delve into key concepts such as the origins of life, biological diversity, and ecological interconnectedness. Use clear explanations and examples to illustrate these concepts and demonstrate their relevance to understanding the complexity of life on our planet.\"  \n...  \nAlso, the essay does require references. However, you can just use your general knowledge and I'll find appropriate references. Please do however, put a small 1, 2, 3 etc after each sentence where a reference is warranted. I'll do the searching and fill up the reference list myself.  \n...  \nAlso one aim of the project is to ensure the marker does not think an essay is AI written, therefore I ask you to emulate an \"English second language learner\" voice to your text.  \n...  \nPlease first provide me with the bulletin outline for all the subtopics in the essay, then I'll prompt you topic by topic accordingly. Cheers ChatGPT!\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nHello! It sounds like you've got an intriguing project on your hands, and I'm excited to help you out. To create an essay that explores the diverse aspects of life on Earth, we'll structure it with a comprehensive outline. Here\u2019s a tentative outline for the essay:\n\n* **Introduction**\n* **Origins of Life**\n* **Biological Diversity**\n* **Ecological Interconnectedness**\n* **Human Impact on Earth's Life**\n* **The Relevance of Understanding Life on Earth**\n* **Conclusion**\n\nThis outline provides a roadmap for discussing the complex and fascinating topic of life on Earth. Now, let's proceed section by section. Just prompt me when you're ready!\n\n**User:**\n\nOk thanks, please do section 1 and 2. Remember to include placeholders for the references and remember to write very simply like an ESL student.\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLife on Earth is a big mystery and beauty. It is full of different kinds of living things, from tiny bacteria to big animals like elephants and whales. We, humans, are also part of this diverse life. Understanding the variety of life and how all living things are connected is very important. This knowledge helps us appreciate our world more and teaches us how to take care of it1.\n\n**Origins of Life**\n\nThe question of how life started on Earth is very interesting and has many theories2. One popular idea is that life began in the ocean, with simple organisms that did not need oxygen to live3. Scientists think that certain conditions were needed for life to start. For example, water is very important for life. Without water, life as we know it would not exist4.\n\nAnother theory suggests that life\u2019s building blocks came from outer space, maybe on comets or meteorites5. These building blocks then mixed with Earth's own materials to start the first life forms6.\n\nNo matter which theory is correct, the start of life on Earth was a complex process that took a long time. It set the stage for all the diverse forms of life we see today7.\n\nWriting in a simplified manner as requested, I included placeholders for references after key points. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the tone further or proceed with the next sections!\n\n**User:**\n\nThanks, now section 3 and 4.\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\n**Biological Diversity**\n\nBiological diversity, or biodiversity, means all the different kinds of life you can find in one area8. This includes plants, animals, fungi, and even tiny microorganisms. Biodiversity is very important because it helps ecosystems work well and stay healthy. Imagine a forest; it has many types of trees, animals, and insects. Each part of this forest depends on the others to live. This balance is what keeps the forest alive9.\n\nEvolution and natural selection are processes that create this diversity10. Evolution means that living things change a little bit over time to adapt to their environment. Natural selection is nature\u2019s way of choosing which living things can do this best. This is how we get so many different species. For example, in a rainy and warm place, you might find lots of different kinds of frogs. This is because the conditions there are good for frogs, and over time, they have changed in small ways to live better in this environment11.\n\nA great example of biodiversity is the Amazon rainforest. It is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that you can\u2019t find anywhere else in the world12. This makes it a very important place for scientists to study and for us to protect.\n\n**Ecological Interconnectedness**\n\nEcological interconnectedness talks about how all living things in an ecosystem are connected to each other13. An ecosystem can be something small like a pond or big like an ocean. In any ecosystem, plants, animals, and other organisms work together in a balance. For example, plants make food from sunlight, and animals eat these plants. Then, other animals eat those animals. This is called a food chain14.\n\nA good example of interconnectedness is how bees pollinate flowers. Bees go from flower to flower to collect nectar, and when they do, they carry pollen with them. This helps plants make seeds and grow new plants15. Without bees, many plants would not be able to reproduce. This shows how one species can be very important to an entire ecosystem16.\n\nAnother example is the relationship between predators and their prey. Predators help control the population of other animals. This balance is important. If there are too many predators, they might eat too many prey animals, and then the predators would have no food. But if there are too few predators, the prey animals might eat too much of the plants. Finding this balance is what makes ecosystems work17.\n\nUnderstanding how all life on Earth is connected helps us see why it is so important to take care of our environment and all the living things in it18.\n\nI kept the explanations straightforward and included placeholders for references as requested. Let me know if you need adjustments or if we can proceed to the next sections!\n\n**User:**\n\nThanks, now 5 and 6.\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\n**Human Impact on Earth's Life**\n\nHumans have a big effect on Earth's life. Sometimes, we change the environment in ways that are not good for other living things. For example, cutting down trees in forests can make it hard for some animals to live there anymore19. Pollution from cars and factories can also make the air and water dirty, which affects plants and animals20.\n\nBut people are trying to fix these problems. We have made laws to protect endangered animals and to keep the air and water clean21. Conservation efforts are also important. This means protecting natural areas and the animals that live there. Some people work in places like national parks or wildlife reserves to help protect these places22.\n\nIt's important for everyone to know about these efforts and to help take care of our planet. This can be as simple as recycling or using less water. Every small action can make a big difference23.\n\n**The Relevance of Understanding Life on Earth**\n\nUnderstanding all the different kinds of life on Earth and how they are connected is very important for many reasons. First, it helps us know how to protect endangered animals and plants. If we know what they need to live, we can help create a better environment for them24.\n\nBiodiversity is also important for people. Many medicines come from plants and animals. If we lose different species, we might also lose the chance to find new medicines25. Healthy ecosystems also give us clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and food to eat26.\n\nEducation plays a big role in this. Schools and museums teach people about the importance of biodiversity and how ecosystems work27. This knowledge can help us make better choices that protect the environment.\n\nIt's up to everyone to help take care of our planet. By understanding the complexity of life on Earth, we can all be better guardians of our home28.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn this essay, we looked at the amazing diversity of life on Earth. We learned about how life started, the many different kinds of living things, and how everything is connected. We also saw how humans can affect the environment, both in bad and good ways. Most importantly, we learned why it's important to understand and protect the biodiversity of our planet.\n\nTaking care of Earth is a big responsibility, but it is also a chance to make sure future generations can enjoy the beauty and richness of our world. Every person can make a difference, and together, we can protect the precious life on our planet.\n\nThis wraps up the sections on human impact and the relevance of understanding life on Earth, complete with the simpler English presentation and reference placeholders. Let me know if there's anything else you need for this project! **(For God's sake delete this paragraph before submitting it to your prof)**\n\n# Now all you need to do is reverse-find the appropriate references for each placeholder and proofread every paragraph for any oddities, such as the last paragraph which proves that you cheated.",
