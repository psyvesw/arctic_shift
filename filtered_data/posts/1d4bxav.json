    "selftext": "I use GPT to help me understand the relationship between different academic articles. For example, when writing, I would ask GPT to remind me what measures they used with citations & how they defined their variables. I always scroll back through the article to verify everything at the end, but it\u2019s easier than scrolling up and down everytime I need something. \n\nWith 4o, it will confidently give me wrong answers. When I tell it that it is giving me the wrong answer, it says variations of \u201csorry, here\u2019s the right answer\u201d and gives me the SAME WRONG ANSWER. It does not matter how many different ways or prompts I give it, it does not budge on the incorrect answers. I can tell GPT it is wrong, GPT will acknowledge it, and give me the exact same incorrect answer back.\n\nI also now have to open new tabs for pretty much each individual paragraph I write. If I ask it to focus on one article, it gives me the data from the correct article using the language from a previous article. If I ask it to focus on helping with a transition for one paragraph in the middle of my writing, it will write exactly what I wrote, but bold the paragraph I asked it to focus on without adding a transition or making writing recommendations.\n\nA benefit of 4o is it reads articles better now than 4.0 (4.0 would always just regurgitate the abstract from uploaded PDFs), but that\u2019s not something I need. I\u2019m familiar with all the articles already, I just need reminders as I write. Balancing the wire of canceling and just using 4.0 again since it\u2019s free. I\u2019m already hiring my 4o limits since I\u2019m having to ask it the same exact question 5+ times. At that point, it IS faster to scroll up and down lol",
