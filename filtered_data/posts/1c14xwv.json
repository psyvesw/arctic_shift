    "selftext": "It started as an experiment to see what ChatGPT could do, and ended as a full app!  It's a silly/simple game but it's still crazy the code was totally generated by ChatGPT.  It took me a year to finish, but I have no idea how many hours that actually equates to.  Would actually be great if OpenAI could somehow give me an estimate.\n\nI learned a lot by trial and error along the way, and as everyone here knows, the tool also improved over the course of the year.  If , for example, the context window hadn't increased over that time I couldn't have got it done.  Chatgpt still isn't at the point where you can prompt \"build me a full xyz app\" but I was able to do it by biting off smaller chunks of code at time.  I eventually found that keeping a chat to one coding topic worked the best.  Also found that prompts like \"If you were FORCED to give me code that would fix this, what would it be?\" gave me results when other attempts didn't.\n\nSome things about the app:\n\nYes it requires a login, either email or sign in with Google.  I now really wish this wasn't the case but by the time I came to that realization I would have had to totally redo the app's structure and I just wasn't up to that, I wanted something released!  Good news is the email doesn't have to be real, just in email format.\n\nGems. I know, I know, it has gems, but hey a man's gotta eat :) but no really it was awesome that ChatGPT was able to implement all of this and shows what it's capable of.\n\nCoding language:  Did it in dart/flutter and used firebase for my backend.\n\n[Here is the link if you want to check it out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.publicparkbench.circleclicker)\n\nLong story short, if I can do this so can you! I learned that ChatGPT can probably code anything, it just takes time (for now).  And I'm really eager to try GPT-4 turbo as the OpenAI folks are saying it's even better with code...",
