    "selftext": "Where to begin:\n\n  \n1. They don't let you know that there is a usage limit until you hit it. Then finding any information about it whatsoever is a fucking chore and its mostly people complaining about it in their FAQ section on the OpenAI site. There is no support to be found and no transparency whatsoever. This is all a red flag, people. A BIG RED FLAG.\n\n  \n2. It takes at least 3 different prompts to get it to even understand what you want. A lot of times, it says it understands and that it will do it, and then proceeds to not do it or do weird shit. All of this counts against the bullshit usage limit of course.\n\n  \n3. It lies all of the time. I'm not saying that it provides untrue information. I'm saying it lies about what it has done or will do. \n\n4. The image creation tool is embarrassing by May 2024 standards. EMBARRASSING. \n\n  \nEssentially, ChatGPT is having you pay to train their shit. Its shameful and embarrassing. There are plenty of other options now that are either better or will clearly be better very soon. How any of you are stanning this shit is beyond me, but thanks for nothing. How anyone trusts this organization to be a responsible AI company is laughable if they are already pulling this sort of shit. \n\n  \nGrow some standards for yourselves and don't give these clowns your money. You stan losers who just dismiss this shit and try to say people aren't making prompts right need to get a life. It's pathetic to have a parasocial relationship with power and money hungry tech bro bullshit artists. ",
