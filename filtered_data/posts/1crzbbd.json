    "selftext": "I have seen a lot of posts and questions seeking what is the origin and/or name of the color scheme ChatGPT is using for its code display. I find it visually very beautiful and accessible in the way that I navigate through it very fast. It's a very well thought scheme. The answer is that sadly, there is no actually source, and I have came to three conclusions that should answer our answers. I too tried to find it and use it, but I dislike the existing themes.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Conclusion 1 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nThis could, pretty much be a VIM originated theme. One that was inspired and built either by experimenting and combining from old school VIM code screenshots and themes or they have found a nice screenshot and took the colors from there, where its origin and the author is lost in the abyss of history. It could as well be one developer of OpenAI that uses the same colors since 90's or something. Basically, if you dig the history, there are literally thousands and thousands of screenshots of VIM/Emacs and terminal configurations using similar style, some matching exactly, but with rotated color orders (operators green, methods black, whatever). You can even reverse a code screenshot in Yandex and you will find tons of similarities, with no themes link to them. (Ex: [1](https://prnt.sc/6kKS7fWlMpDd), [2](https://prnt.sc/ti8dcciu9tEd), [3](https://prnt.sc/4wFBsR60Rw9A)\n\nTLDR: It's pointless to search. It's probably just a in house made skin using older VIM/Emacs configs as reference.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Conclusion 2 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nThe colors used in the theme are:\n\n* \"#2e95d3\" which is variant of blue \\[\n* \"#f22c3d\" which is variant of red\n* \"#e9950c\" which is variant of orange\n* \"#808080\" which is gray\n* \"#00a37d\" which is variant green\n* \"#df3079\" which is variant of fuchsia (royal fuchsia)\n* \"#ffffff\" which is white (general purpose)\n* \"#000000\" which is black (background)\n\nFrom this point, since you've got the colors, it should be fairy easy to customize your IDE/Editor anyway.\n\nThe only theme I can think of containing variants of blue, red, orange, gray, green, fuchsia (or pinkish) and white is [Monkai](https://github.com/tanvirtin/monokai.nvim). Which is a very well thought theme, that has been the default theme of Sublime Text with a paid pro edition. So this theme is very well psychologically engineered as it appeals on large scope, it would make sense to inspire OpenAI to use something similar.\n\nHere is Monkai with black background: [https://github.com/matkl/Monokai-Black](https://github.com/matkl/Monokai-Black) (Very very very similar)\n\nConclusion. OpenAI used a slightly modified version of Monokai with different shades of its colors and different syntax highlighting order.\n\n  \n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Conclusion 3 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n  \nModified version of [Midnight theme from Xcode IDE from Apple](https://youtu.be/9tDD6FU1PZ8?t=19). This one is highly likely, as OpenAI probably has lots and lots of Starbucks ice coffee programmers who swear by Apple.",
