    "selftext": "I mainly use ChatGPT for data processing for research, which means it's generally better for me that 4o. I just spent about 30 hours straight getting it to comprehend some data in a PDF without hallucinating and it just... wouldn't. It would for one file, then if I sent the second and said do the same thing it'd be back to hallucinating for ten minutes despite the two PDFs actually being just the same thing split to reduce the memory usage. In the same time, I was trying to get it to help me set up some code and it got caught in a recursive loop multiple times and provided me with the same two (non-working) answers regardless of what my input actually was, to the point my input didn't always relate to the output.\nI get that the real market here is getting general users to rely on GPT more. That said, there's a lot of us who need heavy technical use of an LLM for reasons that are outside \"we're part of a company that can afford and pay for the latest and greatest\"\n\nI'm really disappointed, I've been paying for it since the first week or so you could pay for it but I'm officially at a point with ChatGPT where debugging is more time consuming than manual data entry or just coding myself, which is a shocking change from only a couple of months ago.\n\nOpenAI needs an academic version which doesn't trade robust data processing for novelty features like voice. I get that this is where the money (and training data) is but it's disappointing to have gone on a ride of extra productivity which has vanished.",
