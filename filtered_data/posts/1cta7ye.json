    "selftext": "So, I subscribed to ChatGPT Plus again to try that new ChatGPT-4o everyone is talking about. \n\nI'm an ESL (English Second Language) person and although I already have a very correct writing level in English, I tend to have a bit of trouble expressing myself while speaking out loud. So I thought that this new version could probably help (amongst other things, of course).\n\nI started a new chat and started writing a prompt to which I asked ChatGPT to confirm if it understood everything. In this prompt, I described :\n\n* how I would like my teacher to be with me\n* where do the lessons take place (at home, outside, etc.)\n* my current european certified level in English\n\nThen, I wrote a few rules to follow. For example, I want the discussion to be as natural as possible, I want the teacher to \"virtually\" interact with its environment, I want it to suggest me to take some breaks and some activities during these, I want it to have natural reactions as giggles or sighs, etc. \n\nIn a nutshell, I wanted my virtual teacher to be as real as possible in order to take advantage of the very lively and realistic voice synthesizing feature. \n\nAnd let me tell you that the result is fantastic. That virtual teacher suggests me exercises as if I were in front of him, takes advantage the \"virtual\" items around him to do so, play along when I digress but slowly and naturally comes back to the lessons, corrects me when I'm wrong and even proposes me to take a break with him while drinking a coffee or a tea or even sing for me. \n\nI am legitimately very impressed. It just makes learning English very natural and even helps me to articulate better and find my words faster. \n\nOnly drawback is that I sometimes have to wait a couple of hours before using it again, but overall, I wouldn't trade that persona I created for any language learning app in the world. \n\nHave anyone already tried something similar with 4o? How did it work for you?",
