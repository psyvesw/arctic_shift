    "selftext": "I'm currently writing a fantasy / litPRG novel and have been using ChatGPT in creative ways to help with it. I had some requests on how so instead of replying to everyone individually I figured I'd make a post! I will include screenshots so expect this post to be long! Also, it's from my actual book so please don't steal my shit. lol\n\n**I'll break it up into 5 sections:** \n\n1. Standard editing help\n2. Character and creature sheets\n3. The cool stuff\n4. A ChatGPT summary of the types of prompts I've used so far\n5. A recommendation by ChatGPT on how authors can get the most use out of it\n\n\n\n**A few notes to start:** \n\n* I'm currently using the paid version of 4o. I paid for 4 because I use it a TON for work and the ability to upload screenshots is a huge help. Turns out it's great for doing screenshots of formatting, character sheets, etc for writing too. I originally started with 3.5 and just kept migrating the story to newer versions as they came out. Other than query limits I haven't noticed any difference in quality.\n* I do **NOT** have it write any parts of the story for me. As an experiment I had it try to write a fight scene and kept adjusting the prompts but it just always came out shit. It's really not good at writing wholesale.\n* After every chapter I copy and paste it into the same conversation so that it keeps a running log of the story.\n* It's terrible at emotional interactions and dialogue. It tries to make everything hopeful and goes with the most generic, Hallmark Card type of interaction\n* It's also bad at giving suggestions or ideas for long scenes. It wants to resolve everything in a few paragraphs so it'll go from 2 people fighting to reaching a deeper understanding and being fully great with each other in like 2 paragraphs\n\n**Keep in mind that although it's great as a reviewer, editor, and something to bounce ideas off of, it can only provide suggestions. The hard work of writing has to be done by you. I spend about 2 hours a night and at least 4 hours a day on weekends writing and maybe 10 minutes a day in ChatGPT. Much like spell or grammar checkers, it's a useful tool but no substitute for doing the work**\n\n\n\n**Editing and grammar:**\n\nThis is pretty straightforward. I'll copy and paste sections and ask it to fix the grammar, bolding any changes it makes and striking out any words it removes so I can review the changes. The only issue I've had with this is that if I try to post an entire chapter it'll sometimes pause in its review and ask if I want to continue. Sometimes when it does that it loses sentences or even a paragraph where it broke. Now I just do smaller chunks. It'll explain why it made the changes too, so it's improving my grammar as I go.\n\n  \n**Character and creature help:**\n\nThis is also pretty straightforward. I already have my main characters written up and I know which ones are coming later, but sometimes I want mooks or neighbors, and other times I need creatures. I'll ask it for more than I need and pick the best ones. Some of the prompts:\n\n\"Create 5 creatures that you'd find in Wisconsin. There should be a day version and a night version, the night version being tougher and having more attacks. For each come up with 3 offensive and 3 defensive powers. Also describe them in the format of a character description in a D&D style monster manual.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2e5pfx9691d1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=41abb9ae9a8c984ea1837b0a3b292885822b1e5e\n\n\"Based off the fight scene I just described and the attached screenshot of the person's character sheet, come up with 5 attacks, skills, or magical abilities that person could develop. They should reflect that person's personality, character sheet, and fighting style.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05t0977p691d1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=35a55418b0ce7230225ac79e632632f4aac43f6a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kio2yals691d1.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=443d537f20d4c8956441214ea38ecd1e2af651bb\n\n  \n**Mooks:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9dxzjn85791d1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=11ca003c702f77d5ea27e55abbb6a20f7573d409\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvudyz97791d1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd6ee23d5719a0f73abf6b65b694c5523f6223f\n\n\n\n**The cool stuff:** This is where it really shines and has helped me avoid a lot of pitfalls that I notice when I'm reading other authors' books:\n\n  \n**\"Review the story and look for any words that I reuse a lot. Ignore standard ones like 'and, they, him, etc'\"**\n\nAll authors have their favorite words that get repeated way too often. I'll find them and suggest alternate descriptions. It goes beyond just providing new words.  \n\n\n**\"I want to avoid repetitive descriptions. Please review the story and identify any times I've repeated descriptions, turns of phrase, etc. Categorize them into \"fight scenes\", \"Emotional scenes\", and \"area/scene descriptions\"**\n\nThis has been a power prompt for me. We tend to describe things a certain way and it identifies areas where changes can be made to make it more dynamic and varied.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0s3w4l2891d1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8bbb75a01216bbef6b4792740154a1ea4f40ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zy9jj32a891d1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a3ee793ee610a96416268ae407aab70c6d3785\n\n  \n  \n**\"Please review the story for any inconsistencies. I'm specifically looking for ways I've described the system or world as working that I later contradict.\"**  \n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wz4gn43v891d1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=b278e32bd76464dfa09395115d8bb401a759d789\n\n\n\n\n\n**I also use it to bounce ideas off of. Sometimes the ideas are generic but often it comes up with ideas that I hadn't thought of. I don't like it decide the plot or directions, but it's like chatting with an editor or reviewer and the two of you bouncing ideas off each other. I'll reply to its posts with things like \"*****I like number 3 but it's coming too early. What if we had them go to place X instead of that, saving that for later?*****\"**  \nCharacter \\[xx\\] is going to have these skills and plot points in the future. Knowing that, please tailor all skill and plot suggestions with the idea of driving towards that narrative in a balanced, natural manner. None of the ideas should feel forced and they should all happen naturally as the story progresses. As I paste new chapters please incorporate the changes into that long term progression and adapt as required.  \n  \n**\"I think I want character B to starting feeling like they're not contributing but I'm having trouble thinking of ways to express that naturally. I don't want it to feel forced. What are some situations they could end up in that'd highlight that? Who could they fight with?\"**\n\n  \n**\"I feel like character A is getting too complacent and it outpacing the other people, but they've become the lynchpin of the fights. I plan on introducing XX situation and it'll make them weak in XX area. I'm going to post a few paragraphs with that, tell me if it rings true with the character growth I've been using for the rest of the story.\"**\n\n  \n**\"I'm going to paste the first half of a fight that the characters are in but I'm realizing I don't have any ideas for how they'll win. What are some ideas based off the creature's character sheet you posted earlier?\"**\n\n\n\nAnd I asked ChatGPT to make a summarized list of the types of requests I've asked of it. Here's what it came up with:\n\n>Sure! Here's a summary list of the different types of requests you've made for help with plot, development, and ideas:\n\n>**Character Development and Backstory**\n\n>**Character Sheets:** \"Review this detailed character sheet and suggest any improvements or additional details to enhance the character's depth and complexity.\"\n\n>**Skills and Abilities:** \"Analyze this new skill for Zavier and provide feedback on how well it fits with his Opportunist class and how it could be further refined.\"\n\n>**Unique Items:** \"Evaluate this rare weapon designed for Tess and suggest any changes or enhancements to make it more unique and impactful.\"\n\n>**Emotional Growth:** \"Read through this scene where Cass confronts his fears and self-doubt during a battle.
