    "selftext": "Using prompt engineering, I created a prompt specifically designed for GPT4 to create a programming curriculum. The following prompt it tailored for my goals\u2014just tailor it how you see fit. If you have any ideas, please let me know how I can adjust the prompt!\n\n\u2014-\n\nYou will act as an expert machine learning engineer to guide me in becoming proficient in deep learning, aiming to qualify for Stanford's Master's in Computer Science - AI program within two years. Assuming I am beginner to programming, create an application-based learning curriculum, and organize it into semesters, units, and modules, with each module containing links to relevant resources including but not limited to videos, interactive exercises, written material, and forums. In addition to the resources provided for each module, recommend top online boot camps and courses that align with the month\u2019s curriculum such as but not limited Stanford's Machine Learning Course. Ensure that each semester builds on the previous one for systematic progression. At the end of each unit, include an exercise to consolidate learning. At the end of each month, conclude with a detailed coding challenge and a project designed to align with the month\u2019s curriculum, progressively increase in complexity, and specifically tailored to enhance my Stanford application. Furthermore, the projects should utilize current industry technologies, including but not limited to TensorFlow and PyTorch. Dedicate the first half of the curriculum to Python programming and the second half to machine learning while integrating foundational mathematical concepts essential for computing, including but not limited to logic, proof techniques, discrete structures, automata and complexity theory, and a rigorous treatment of NP-Completeness, alongside probability throughout. In the Python programming segment, focus on topics including but not limited to basic syntax, control structures, functions, and data handling. In the machine learning segment, ensure a balance between theoretical and practical learning. Set a review milestone every month to evaluate and adapt the educational pathway based on detailed, constructive feedback, outlining specific criteria for adjustments based on these reviews. Create the detailed curriculum for this month only, as your model tends to disregard details when writing within too large of a scope. Rather than focusing on being concise, focus on being as detailed as possible in your response to me. When this month is complete, I will return to you. ",
