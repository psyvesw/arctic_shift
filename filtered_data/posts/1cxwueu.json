    "selftext": "Yesterday I received my feedback for the assignment that I wrote fully by myself without any help of any AI tool or paraphrasing tool, as I think that it is not fair towards myself and towards the community. I was sure that I will get pretty good mark, but later my Professor told me that my paper is showing 90% of AI.\n\nImagine my feeling now, as I really did a hard - work, I was working on that paper for 1 week, and now hearing such result is ridiculous for me. Even the fact that instructors checks AI by using another AI is pretty questionable. I really was trusting this engine previously as my other assignments were checked very well, however from now on I have big doubts about reliability to this engine in checking AI content.\n\nPlease give me some tips how can I prove to our Dean (instructor said that I should not bother him with this problem anymore) that I wrote this paper by myself without any other help?",
