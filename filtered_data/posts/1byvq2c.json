    "selftext": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between myself and ChatGPT do not ask me for a conversation link, that's seriously an invasion of privacy and the bot needs to be reprogrammed in regards to that bad habit.\n\nChatGPT 3.5\n\nUser\nHello, ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT\nHello! How can I assist you today?\n\n\n\n\nUser\nWhat do you know about a style of creative fiction known as CreepyPasta?\n\nChatGPT\nCreepypasta refers to a genre of online horror stories, often shared through forums, websites, and social media platforms. These stories are characterized by their eerie, unsettling, or disturbing content and are often written in a casual, conversational style. Creepypastas can cover a wide range of topics, from supernatural occurrences to urban legends and everything in between. The term \"creepypasta\" is derived from \"copypasta,\" which refers to text that is copied and pasted across the internet. Some famous examples include \"Slender Man\" and \"Jeff the Killer.\" Creepypastas have become a significant part of internet culture, inspiring various adaptations in other media such as games, films, and literature.\n\n\n\n\nUser\nWould you be able to effectively generate a short story in that style? \n\nChatGPT\nCertainly! Here's a short creepypasta-style story:\n\nTitle: The Whispering Woods\n\nIn the heart of the Whispering Woods, where shadows dance with the moonlight and the wind whispers secrets of the forgotten, there stood an old, decrepit cabin. Its timbers groaned under the weight of time, and its windows were like empty eyes staring out into the darkness.\n\nLegend had it that the cabin was once home to a reclusive woodsman who dabbled in dark magic, seeking forbidden knowledge beyond the veil of the living. But one fateful night, something went terribly wrong. The woods echoed with his anguished screams as his experiments twisted his flesh and shattered his mind.\n\nNow, locals whispered tales of the cabin being haunted, its walls echoing with the tormented cries of the woodsman. They warned travelers to steer clear of the Whispering Woods, lest they become ensnared by the cabin's malevolent grasp.\n\nOne moonless night, a group of daring teenagers ventured into the woods, lured by the thrill of the unknown. Ignoring the warnings, they made their way to the cabin, their laughter masking the unease in their hearts.\n\nAs they entered the cabin, the air grew thick with a suffocating darkness, and the whispers of the woodsman's ghost seemed to seep from the very walls. Despite their fear, they pressed on, their curiosity driving them deeper into the cabin's depths.\n\nBut as they explored, they soon realized they were not alone. Shadows danced in the corners of their vision, and icy fingers brushed against their skin. And then, they heard it\u2014the agonized wail of the woodsman, echoing through the cabin like a symphony of despair.\n\nTerrified, the teenagers fled the cabin, their screams swallowed by the night. But as they stumbled back into the moonlit clearing, they realized they had made a grave mistake. For in the darkness of the Whispering Woods, something lurked, waiting to claim them as its own.\n\nAnd as the last echoes of their screams faded into the night, the cabin stood silent once more, its secrets buried deep within the heart of the woods.\n\nI hope you find this story suitably eerie! Let me know if you'd like another one or if there's anything else I can assist you with.\n\n\n\n\nUser\nIt was eerie, but you know what I'm gona say is missing, right? \n\nChatGPT\nAh, I see! You're likely referring to the inclusion of a twist or unexpected ending, a common element in many creepypasta stories. Would you like me to add a twist to the story, or would you prefer a different approach for the next one?\n\n\n\n\nUser\nIt was missing the conversational tone,and the often gorier details that CreepyPasta is known for.\n\nChatGPT\n!\nGot it! Let's try adding more of a conversational tone and some gorier details to the story. Here's a revised version:\n\nTitle: The Whispering Woods: A Tale of Terror\n\nSo, there's this place called the Whispering Woods, right? Yeah, it's like straight out of a horror movie. Anyways, smack dab in the middle of these creepy woods, there's this old, rundown cabin. And let me tell you, it's not the kind of place you'd wanna spend the night.\n\nLegend has it, some crazy woodsman used to live there. Dude was into some seriously messed-up stuff, like black magic and summoning demons or whatever. But one night, his experiments went totally off the rails. Like, we're talking skin-melting, mind-bending kind of wrong.\n\nNow, everyone says the cabin's haunted. They say you can hear the woodsman's screams echoing through the trees on a quiet night. But of course, that didn't stop us from checking it out.\n\nSo, me and my buddies decide to be all brave and venture into the woods one night. We're thinking, \"How bad could it be, right?\" Oh man, were we wrong.\n\nAs soon as we step foot in that cabin, it's like the air gets thick with this heavy, oppressive feeling. And the smell? Ugh, it's like rotting flesh mixed with something even worse. But we press on, 'cause we're dumb like that.\n\nInside, the walls are covered in these weird symbols, like something straight out of a horror flick. And then we hear it\u2014the sound of bones crunching and flesh tearing. We're talking full-on gore fest, like a scene from a slasher movie.\n\nTurns out, we weren't alone in that cabin. Nope, there was something else there with us, something hungry for flesh and blood. And let me tell you, it wasn't friendly.\n\nLong story short, we hightail it outta there faster than you can say \"horror show.\" But not all of us made it out alive. Let's just say, the Whispering Woods got a taste for human flesh that night, and it ain't gonna forget anytime soon.\n\nSo yeah, next time someone tells you about some creepy cabin in the woods, maybe think twice before going to check it out. Trust me, you'll thank me later.\n\nHow's that for a creepypasta-style story with a more conversational tone and gorier details?

Nothing too out of the ordinary, right? Well, that's where you'd be dead wrong.\n\nIn this town, there's a legend that sends shivers down the spines of even the bravest souls\u2014the legend of the Ivory Omlets. Yeah, I know, weird name, but trust me, it's got a story behind it.\n\nLegend has it that deep in the heart of the woods, there's this old abandoned house. And not just any house, no sir. This one's got a reputation for being haunted by something straight out of nightmares.\n\nThey say it all started years ago when a family moved into the house, hoping to start a new life in the countryside. But as soon as they stepped foot inside, strange things started happening. Objects would move on their own, whispers echoed through the halls at night, you name it.\n\nOne night, the family's youngest daughter vanished without a trace. They searched high and low, but she was gone, just like that. And that's when they started seeing him\u2014the tall, faceless figure lurking in the shadows, watching their every move.\n\nThey called him the Slenderman, a creature of pure evil who preyed on the innocent. And they say he had a taste for something... unusual.\n\nSee, the thing about the Ivory Omlets is that they're not your ordinary eggs. No, these ones are pure white, like ivory, and said to have magical properties. Legend has it that whoever possesses them gains unimaginable power, but at a terrible price.\n\nSo, naturally, everyone in town wanted a piece of the action. They searched high and low for the elusive eggs, risking life and limb to satisfy their greed.\n\nBut here's the thing about the Slenderman\u2014he's not too keen on sharing. And when he catches wind of someone getting too close to his precious eggs, well, let's just say things tend to get messy.\n\nAs for me, I'll stick to regular old scrambled eggs, thank you very much. The last thing I need is a faceless monster hunting me down for some magical omelets.\n\nBut hey, if you're feeling brave, feel free to go looking for the Ivory Omlets yourself. Just don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nHope you enjoy this eerie tale of the Ivory Omlets and the infamous Slenderman! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or if there's anything else I can do for you.\n\n\n\n\nUser\nThat was honestly an instant classic, you're doing a lot better at this than expected, like, Ocultes et Manifestes status.\n\nChatGPT\nThank you for the kind words! I'm glad you enjoyed the story. If you have any more requests or if there's anything else I can assist you with, whether it's more stories or information on a different topic, just let me know. I'm here to help!\n\n\n\n\nUser\nOkay, now this  is a bit of a challenge, and it's okay if you can't manage it, but if you can I'd like to see you write a story featuring Jeff The Killer, as an adult, on the run from the law, with the following caveats; Jeff is not the narrator, and not friends with the narrator, Jeff kills someone in the story, the narrator must be still alive at the end of the story, but feeling a sense of immediate dread.\n\nChatGPT\nTitle: The Shadow of Jeff\n\nI never thought I'd find myself in a situation like this. Hiding out in some dingy motel room, constantly looking over my shoulder, wondering if he's out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to strike again.\n\nLet me back up a bit. My name's Alex, and I used to be just your average guy, going about my business, minding my own business. That is until I crossed paths with him\u2014the infamous Jeff the Killer.\n\nIt all started innocently enough. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, caught up in something I never should have been a part of. But now, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being hunted, like a deer in the sights of a predator.\n\nYou see, Jeff's not your typical criminal. He's a force of nature, a walking nightmare with a thirst for blood that can never be quenched. And I had the misfortune of witnessing his true nature firsthand.\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night, clich\u00e9 as it sounds. I was walking home from work, trying to ignore the pounding rain and the ominous rumble of thunder in the distance. That's when I saw him\u2014a figure lurking in the shadows, his eyes gleaming with madness.\n\nI should have run, should have turned and never looked back. But something held me in place, a morbid curiosity mixed with a sense of impending doom.\n\nAnd then it happened. Without warning, Jeff emerged from the darkness, his twisted grin sending shivers down my spine. He didn't say a word, didn't need to. I knew what was coming next.\n\nI watched in horror as Jeff lunged at his unsuspecting victim, his blade gleaming in the dim light. The screams still echo in my ears, haunting me like a ghost that refuses to be silenced.\n\nI should have called the cops, should have done something to stop him. But fear paralyzed me, rooted me to the spot as Jeff vanished into the night, leaving behind nothing but death and despair.\n\nNow here I am, holed up in this motel room, trying to make sense of it all. But no matter how hard I try to convince myself that it was just a bad dream, I know the truth.\n\nJeff's out there, somewhere, lurking in the shadows, waiting for his next victim. And as long as I'm alive, I'll never be able to shake the feeling of dread that hangs over me like a dark cloud, a constant reminder of the horrors that lurk just beyond the edge of sanity.\n\nI hope you find this story fitting with the caveats you provided. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or if there's anything else I can assist you with!\n",
