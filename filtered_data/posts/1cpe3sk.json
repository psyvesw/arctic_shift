    "selftext": "I was doing poorly, not getting a proper job, and financial insecurity was giving me a lot of weird anxiety. Not knowing how my life would be 2-3 months from now, I tried to find whatever I could to make money and wasn't too successful at it. Variable income is always this struggle. You never know how the next month is going to be.\n\nBut then a friend had a conversation with a guy who told her that he wasn't finding a good fit for a position he was hiring for. He remembered me and asked her to contact me and see if I was interested.\n\nThe position is for a data analyst in a bank. It's not my area, and I have no experience with it. However, I have a degree in science and did a PhD for 4 years (although I never finished it). I am also 34. So, no experience and not that young... But he gave it a shot and we had an interview. He wasn't sure about me yet so he proposed to send me a case study with mock data and asked me to create a prediction model using statistics and AI.\n\nAlthough I have no experience, I like the subject and have studied it in the past. I just never practiced it for real. I had 5 days to prepare, and oh boy, ChatGPT was used extensively. Not in a bad way. I used it mainly to focus my study and direct my learning quickly. I used so many chats, asking every question and about every term. I made so many notes, cross-referenced with ChatGPT and other sources.\n\nThey knew I wasn't going to become an expert in a week, but they wanted to see if I could at least be confident and show that I could walk the walk. I made my presentation a couple of days ago and thought I would have to wait for at least a week. But no, they called me yesterday and offered me a job. Five times more money than I was making in a good month, plus health and dental benefits now.\n\nThis is a remarkable era and we can learn so much more easily than ever!",
