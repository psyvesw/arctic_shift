    "selftext": "I have no idea if this has ever happened to anyone else, and perhaps I was the one in the wrong, but I still felt like I needed to share my experience with you.\n\n  \nBasically, ever since I started ChatGPT many months ago, I've been using many different conversations, but there was one that I always used since it helped write a personal project of mine. I hadn't realised until today just how long this convo was. Just to give a good representation, I've copied and pasted its entirety in a Word document, and it calculated that there were approximately 85 000 words. Safe to say that it was pretty substantial. On top of that, I had successfully created the exact context that I wanted for ChatGPT to better understand and answer my questions.\n\n  \nAll was going well, when out of nowhere, ChatGPT offers me a free trial for GPT-4o. How could I refuse? Free? Don't mind if I do! That was yesterday, or the day before, I don't remember. But, one of the first things I did was test the feature which allows it to analyze an attachment, and it worked just fine. Of course, I used this feature in my main convo, as it was part of my personal project. The day passed and nothing really happened, so I moved on and didn't really use the features of GPT-4o anymore, as I didn't need to for my project.\n\n  \nFast forward to today. As I'm continuing to use my main convo, I get a notice saying that my free trial is over. I'm like ok, let's switch back to GPT-3.5. But that's the thing, I can't. Why? Because I've sent an attachment, once... I try to delete it, but of course, I can't either. What kind of crap is that? Every other message and answer, I can remove or modify just fine, but not attachments? This is just ridiculous... So, I'm basically locked out of my main conversation on which I've passed the last monthts working on to get ChatGPT to get a good grasp on the narrative and universe of my project...\n\n  \nYou can bet that I wasted no time in contacting the support of OpenAI. Safe to say that it was fruitless. They asked me to just manually re-enter the entirety of my convo or just key points. Yeah, right 85 000 words... That's gonna be fun! I can't just copy and paste everything because of the data limit per message. I believe it is around 600 words max. Therefore, I'll just never use that convo again and start a brand new one! Yay! What a good way to advertise your products, OpenAI! Guess what? That was the final nail in the coffin for me... I'm never gonna buy anything from you.",
