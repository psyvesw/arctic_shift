    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm an elementary school teacher from Germany using ChatGPT in my classroom in different ways to make learning more fun and effective. So far I am just winging it and seeing what sticks. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done so far:\n\n    \n-Helped students get feedback and improve their stories.\n\n-Used voice to text to help with reading aloud and enunciation.\n\n-Took photos of homework worksheets to create core concept sheets for better understanding.\n\n-Made advanced questions and contextual assignments to match students\u2019 interests.\n\n-Created questions to deepen understanding of the material.\n\n- Made guides for parents to help with homework.\n\n- had students make posters on the benefits and dangers of AI and fed that into CHatGPT to assist in transforming that content into a podcast that my students then recoreded with GarageBand\n\n\nBut I need some help and advice:\n\n-Improving GPT Responses: Sometimes the answers I get are too detailed or not focused enough. How can I make GPT responses better and more to the point?\n\n-Homework Assistance Bot: I want to build a bot that students can use in the morning to review their homework. They can scan their homework, find mistakes, and understand what they did right and wrong. It could also ask deeper questions for my advanced students. I think this will make homework more effective, especially for those who struggle and don\u2019t get enough feedback. I have seen GPTs where you just have to type in a number to continue and it guides you through a predetermined set of questions. Something like that would be sweet for my young students.\n\nNext school year, we\u2019ll get access to a ChatGPT API, and hopefully, all students will get tablets. It seems like our state is setting us up to experiment. Data protection laws might become an issue, but as long as all student work uploaded is anonymous, we should be good\u2014though nobody knows exactly how it will work yet.\n\nI'm also working on showing my still skeptical colleagues the benefits of AI. My principal is supportive and sees the potential, even if they don\u2019t fully get it yet. They\u2019re encouraging me to help my colleagues see the value too. A lot of them are super skeptical. They think it is just the next toy that will fry our students brain not seeing the incredible potential IF used right. Please, please help me! I feel like a Trailblazer exploring a whole new world of education. There literally is nothing to work off of. Exciting times but also really challenging.",
