    "selftext": "Hiya friends and strangers,  \nWe started around a year ago,  \nand now we're finished.  \nThe first batch of music tutorials for ChatGPT are completed, uploaded, and online.  \n  \nWhile half of the world put their money on \"generative audio AI\", where you type in a prompt and then immediately lose control of \"your\" creation which often turns out to be far from what you wanted or envisioned, we went into a very different direction right from the start: creating tracks in a \\*collaboration\\* with AI.  \nIt's like AI is your co-producer and you exchange ideas and creativity back and forth. (or you are a co-producer to the AI?).  \nIt's about working together, not reducing an AI to a mere \"tool\".  \n  \nThis is all a bit hard and complicated to explain, so check the linked tutorials to see what we mean.  \n  \nThe focus here is electronic music, mostly Techno and its subgenres such as Hardcore, Doomcore, Gabber... yeah the sound is getting pretty grim and dark at times, yet sure to send the dancefloor into a frenzy (we hope!).  \nBut all of this can be easily adapted to a genre of your liking. Want to create synthwave, postpunk, gothtronic, ibiza-house?  \nJust tweak the prompts a bit (often you just need to exchange the word \"Techno\" with your own genre in the prompt).  \n  \nThe tutorials are quite varied and cover multiple topics; like brainstorming ideas for a track; getting hints for mastering and the mixdown; specific prompts for basslines, melodies, vocals, sound FX... and, most importantly: tutorials for writing complete tracks (even albums!) together with ChatGPT, from start to scratch, where ChatGPT outputs every note, every rhythm pattern, every harmonic progression... (and even writes the lyrics!)  \n  \nOh yeah, we nearly forget to mention this: ChatGPT does not \\*generate\\* the audio in these tutorials! It \\*writes\\* the song or track for you, and you can then transfer or import / export this data into your favorite DAW or studio setup... and this means, if you have a spiffy setup, the sound will be grand right from the start (as compared to some \"generative AI\" things...)  \n  \nAnd last but not least, as there are many naysayers and \"un-professional non-believers\" on the internet, who will say \"it cannot be done\", \"you are making this up\": let us assure you that it can be done, because we made it!  \nwe \"tested\" the tutorials on our DAWs and setups, and produced several Hardcore and Techno EPs and albums that way; these albums received critical acclaim, there was even a \"remix album\" that had been put out a while ago, on which veteran and established producers from the Techno genres remixed the AI composed tracks. So we got that 'stamp of approval' down.  \n  \nWe won't link this here, as Reddit would probably consider this to be self promotions.  \n  \nAnd now, let's finally get on with the tutorials.  \nIf you have any comment, remark, request, complaint, please let us know!  \n  \nBut until then... happy (or h-AI-ppy?) producing!  \n  \nLinks:  \n  \nHow to write music using ChatGPT: Part 1 -
