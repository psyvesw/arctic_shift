    "selftext": "**Hi everyone,**\n\nA few months ago, I cancelled my ChatGPT Plus subscription due to several issues I've seen echoed here. The quality of answers was deteriorating, it avoided difficult or uncomfortable tasks, and the browsing feature was removed. It also became worse at interpreting documents and images, and the DALL-E feature's capabilities were reduced.\n\nI felt especially frustrated compared to earlier versions from early 2023. Back then, with the right prompts, ChatGPT could deliver incredibly complex and accurate responses. Over the past year and a half, I've logged hundreds of hours using it, only to feel disappointed by the gradual decline in quality. It seemed like the focus shifted from user experience to user acquisition, likely due to the high costs of running language models.\n\nDespite these issues, I was initially happy with ChatGPT Plus, particularly because of the increased speed and reduced wait times. However, the speed improvements seemed to come at the expense of answer quality. The model often ignored prompt parameters, provided vague and lazy responses, and sometimes even suggested I do certain tasks myself instead of offering detailed help.\n\nAs a working student, 25 Euros a month was a significant expense, but it was worth it when I could get valuable assistance. I spent many nights coding, writing, and brainstorming with ChatGPT's help, and it was incredibly useful. Now that my intense learning phase at university is over, I miss those productive nights and am considering resubscribing.\n\nBefore I make a decision, I wanted to consult the ChatGPT community. **Has the service improved? Is it still top of the line, or should I explore other AI options?** I'd love to hear from other long-time users about their experiences and thoughts.\n\nThanks!",
