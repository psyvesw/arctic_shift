    "selftext": "Hi everyone, recently, I have been using GPT-4 a lot to improve my level in SQL, more precisely in terms of querying an existent database, not in creating database from scratch or architecturing it.  \n  \nIndeed, this gem is very good for generating exercises to push my limits and improve my querying level.  \n  \nHowever, recently I haven't been able to find the perfect prompt to encourage GPT to provide me with exercises related to what I'm asking for.  \n  \nIt's mind blowing how he struggles to deliver exactly what I want and he seems to be missing the point.\n\n  \nWhat I want ChatGPT to do is give me an exercise every time I ask for it. This exercise should push me to use the different functions, clauses, joins, mathematical operations, that is to say everything that is possible to query using SQL. To put it simply, I must be able to provide a complete report, around a single theme, where each step or instruction leads naturally to a next one and this for each exercise with a completely different situation from the previous one.\n\nObviously, I don't want it to force me to use all the principles at the same time in a single query to answer the exercise. I prefer that he pushes me to use a few at the same time.\n\nHere is examples of typical exercise that I would like to solve and which I thought about 30 minutes ago :\n\nExample 1 :\n\n    1.Calculate the turnover of companies for each region.\n    2.Identify regions that generated over 2 million in revenue.\n    3.List the top-revenue-generating company within each region that generated over 2 million in revenue.\n    4.Highlight the highest revenue-generating sale for each of the top company by region that generated over 2 million in revenue.\n\nExample 2 :\n\n    1.Gather all book sales that occurred in the last 3 months.\n    2.Calculate the number of sales for each book within this 3-month period and sort the results by the highest sales count.\n    3.Determine the total revenue generated by each book from the sales made in the last 3 months.\n    4.Filter out books that contributed less than 20% of the total revenue.\n    5.Identify the book with the highest sales count in the last 3 months.\n      Identify the book that generated the most revenue in the last 3 months.\n      Identify the book with the least sale count in the last three months.\n\nExample 3 :\n\n`1.Return the unique IDs and addresses for all stores controlled by our video game company.`  \n`2. Return the quantity of each video game in stock for each store.`  \n`3. Calculate the actual stock for each video game based on the sales that occurred in each store.`  \n`4.Identify videogames with stocks below the safety stock (threshold).`  \n`5.Identify stores that have more than three items below the safety stock.`  \n`6.Identify stores that have between 3 and 5 items below the threshold as \"Not a priority\", between 6 and 9 items as \"Priority\", between 10 and 13 as \"Critic\", and more than 14 as \"Maximum priority\"`\n\nAs you can see, these types of exercises would push me to use as many SQL functions and clauses as possible while at the same time practicing with joins and CTE. When I ask ChatGPT to do these kind of exercices, it goes insane and send me the same exercice with one or two minor differences and keep giving the same type of exercices with a slightly different situation.\n\n  \nI don't wanna give up but it's almost as if I won't find the good prompt that would allow ChatGPT to give me these kind of exercices around a unique theme, a unique situation that would push me to generate a large report based on logical and linked instructions. Because when I ask GPT to give me exercises to train, here is how it looks : \n\n[Example of SQL exercice gave by ChatGPT](https://preview.redd.it/tr6uaqk7191d1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e3b0fd251d634eb492c80a50f6f39c051eb663)\n\nWhat it does is, it seperates the instructions and they have not much link between them. It feels weird and I don't see how it would allow me train CTE and have a better understanding of JOINS, I really don't even know how to explain it but I guess someone would understand me here.  \n",
