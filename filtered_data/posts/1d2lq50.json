    "selftext": "Hey Redditors, me and my cofounder were playing with the new GPT4o and did something that fascinated me today.\n\nThought I\u2019d share\u2026\n\nSo we\u2019re both pretty deep into AI, and always looking for ways to leverage it in our work. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been trying to get a handle on how GPT-4o can help with software development. We\u2019ve all heard the hype, but I wanted to see it in action.\n\nI decided to build a CLI (command line interface) from scratch, using GPT-4o as my co-pilot. It\u2019s nothing groundbreaking, but I wanted to see if I could create a fully functional CLI in just one day. Spoiler alert: It totally worked!\n\n**Here\u2019s what went down:**\n\n1. I asked GPT-4o to give me a pros and cons list of different CLI frameworks. I\u2019m a Node.js guy, so I ended up choosing oclif, which GPT-4o thought was a good fit based on my needs.\n2. **Project Structure:**\u00a0GPT-4o was a huge help here. I gave it the basic file names and folder structure I wanted, and it generated the boilerplate code for me. I\u2019m talking command files, services, utilities \u2013 the whole shebang. This saved me tons of time.\n3. The coolest part was writing the commands. I described each one, and GPT-4o generated the code right there. Same with the services that handled things like API interactions.\n4. I didn\u2019t even have to think about unit tests. GPT-4o wrote them automatically!\n5. Of course, there were errors. Turns out AI can\u2019t always predict library version conflicts. But GPT-4o was a champ at debugging, helping me fix those issues quickly.\n6. I wanted to test everything without actually hitting a live API, so I asked GPT-4o to mock the API calls. It did a great job creating fake responses, so I could make sure my code worked as expected.\n7. Once I had a basic CLI running, I started adding more complex features. GPT-4 helped with every step, translating my requirements into actual code.\n8. I even gave GPT-4o the code for the server-side API. It then generated the necessary functions for my CLI to call the API. It\u2019s like it understood the entire system!\n9. The final step was simulating different scenarios. I described how I wanted the CLI to behave in different situations, and GPT-4o wrote the code to make it happen.\n\nOverall, this experiment was a huge success. GPT-4o really helped me build a functional CLI in one day, a task that would have taken me much longer without it. I\u2019m still blown away by how much it helped, especially with things like unit testing and debugging. It\u2019s definitely a game changer for development.\n\nI know some folks are wary of AI tools, but I think GPT-4o is a powerful tool for developers. It may not be replace us right now, but it  significantly sped up our work and made us more efficient.\n\nWhat has been your experience with GPT4o?",
