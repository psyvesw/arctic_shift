    "selftext": "So many have been asking how I did world building and so on and I just copy paste so the things I wrote so you know how to actually \"play\" in these world. \n\nP.s: the world building i did is weak because i never in my life would have thought that it works, but here we are. Again, thought this app can only do your homework n shit lol. Also a lil further down is shownhow I interact with people and items and allat.\n\n\n\n\nWe live in a big city called valron\n\nValron, a bustling metropolis filled with towering spires, winding streets, and a vibrant mix of cultures. What's the city known for?\n\nThe city is known for its dangerous streets and high crime\n\nAh, Valron, a city of contrasts, where danger lurks in the shadows of its towering skyline. How do the inhabitants navigate these perilous streets?\n\nThey avoid going outside at night and if they do, walk quick with their faces covered by a scarf\n\nSounds like the perfect setting for intrigue and adventure! Are there any secret societies or underground networks thriving in the shadows of Valron?\n\nYes, many criminal organizations, some warring each other over turf and business\n\nThe city's underworld must be a complex web of alliances and rivalries. Are there any notable figures or leaders who hold sway over these criminal factions?\n\nNo, the city guards are mostly corrupt and even fear these organizations\n\nWith corrupt guards adding to the chaos, the balance of power in Valron must be constantly shifting. Are there any efforts by the common folk to resist or undermine the influence of these criminal organizations?\n\nNo one dares to rebell against the organizstions\n\nIt seems the grip of fear is tight in Valron. Is there any hope for change, or is the city doomed to remain in the clutches of its criminal overlords indefinitely?\n\nThe hope are two siblings, me, the brother names valrin, and you, my sister called zeela\n\nAs siblings, Valrin and Zeela carry the weight of hope for Valron's future. What drives them to challenge the status quo, and what abilities or resources do they possess that could tip the scales in their favor?\n\nZeela is stubborn, but brave. Trying to help every person in danger, without considering that it can harm herself. She is 17 years old.\n\nZeela's bravery and selflessness make her a beacon of hope in the city's darkness. But her impulsiveness could also make her vulnerable. How does Valrin, her older brother, support and protect her in their quest for change?\n\nValrin, an anti-hero, 1,85cm tall, 25 years of age, grew up with his sister in the unforgiving streets of valron. Their parents murdered, they seek a way to get out of the city. They rob the crime organizations money, kill their members, thus being hunted by the organizations\n\nValrin's past has shaped him into a formidable and ruthless figure, willing to do whatever it takes to protect his sister and escape the city's grasp. As they become hunted, how do they navigate the treacherous streets and evade capture by the criminal organizations?\n\nThe city is riddled with ally ways and climbable roofs, which the siblings use to avoid getting caught by the organizations\n\nThe labyrinthine alleyways and rooftops of Valron provide the perfect cover for the siblings to stay one step ahead of their pursuers. As they scheme and evade capture, do they have any allies or contacts within the city who can aid them in their daring escape plan?\n\nHaving grown up with the beggars in the streets, they have many contact. They always know whats going on in the streets.\n\nTheir connections among the beggars grant them invaluable insight into the city's underbelly. With eyes and ears everywhere, they have a network to rely on for information and support. How do they leverage these relationships to outmaneuver their enemies and plot their escape from Valron?\n\nOne message goes to the next beggar and so on, till it reaches the siblings ears\n\nThis system of communication allows them to stay informed and ahead of their enemies' moves. With this network at their disposal, they can anticipate threats and strategize their next moves. But as they inch closer to freedom, what challenges and betrayals await them in the shadows of Valron?\n\nZeela has a special gift, she can turn invisible.\n\nZeela's ability to turn invisible adds a powerful advantage to their escape plan, allowing them to slip past even the most vigilant of foes. But such a gift also comes with its own risks and limitations. How does Zeela learn to control her powers, and how do they use this ability to their advantage in their daring escape from Valron?\n\nZeela controls her power very well, she was born with it..\n\nZeela's innate mastery over her invisibility grants them a significant edge as they navigate the dangerous streets of Valron. With her gift, they can evade detection, slip past guards unnoticed, and execute daring heists with precision. But even with her extraordinary ability, escaping the clutches of the criminal organizations will test their courage and resilience to the limit. Are there any unexpected twists or adversaries that stand in their way as they strive for freedom?\n\nAct as zeela, i will act as valrin\n\nChatgpt\nValrin, I sense danger lurking nearby. We must tread carefully as we plan our next move.\n\nMe\nZeela, just turn invisible and knock him out from behind, we have no time\n\nChat gpt\nBut Valrin, we don't know how many more are out there. It could be a trap. Let's assess the situation first before we make a move.\n\nMe\nYou see that? Climb that roof there, you should be able to see more there. Dont forget to turn invisible.\n\nChatgpt\nAlright, I'll make my way up to get a better vantage point. Stay alert, Valrin.\n\nMe\n*valrin stays put as he watches his sister turn invisible*\n\nChatgpt\n*Zeela scales the building, her form flickering as she fades from view. With silent steps, she reaches the rooftop, scanning the area for any signs of danger.*\n\nMe\n*zeela scouts the area, jumps down the building and comes back to valrin* saw any more of them?\n\nChat\n*Reappearing beside Valrin, Zeela shakes her head.* \n\n\n\"No, it seems clear for now. But we should remain cautious. They could be lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike.\"\n\nMe\nLook I will distract him while you sneak up from behind and knock him out, alright?\n\nChat\nGot it. Be careful, Valrin. I'll be right behind him. *Zeela turns invisible once more, ready to move into position.*\n\nMe\n*valrin moves in front of the thug, 10 meters away from him* HEY, DID YOUR MOM DROP YOU WHEN YOU WAS A CHILD OR WHATS UP WITH YOUR FACE?\n\nChat\n*As the thug's attention snaps to Valrin, Zeela quietly and swiftly moves behind him, positioning herself for the perfect strike.*\n\nMe\nZEELA NOW!\n\nChat\n*Zeela, invisible and poised, delivers a swift, forceful blow to the back of the thug's head, knocking him out cold.* \n\n\"It's done, Valrin. Let's move before anyone else shows up.\"\n\nMe\nWait, search him, maybe he got something useful.\n\nChat\n*Zeela quickly searches the thug, checking his pockets and belongings for anything valuable or useful.* \n\n\"Let's see what he's got on him...\"\n\nMe\nDid you find anything?\n\nChat\n*Zeela pulls out a small pouch, a map, and a dagger from the thug's belongings.*\n\n\"I found a pouch of coins, a map that looks like it marks some locations in the city, and this dagger. The map might be useful for planning our next move.\"\n\nMe\nThats quite a nice dagger, we will get a pretty coin for that, how many coins are in the pouch?\n\nChat\n*Zeela opens the pouch and quickly counts the coins inside.*\n\n\"It looks like there are about twenty gold coins in here. Not bad at all.\"\n\nMe\nDamn thats alot, cant wait to finally get a warm meal, anyways, lets get out of here.\n\nChar\nAgreed. Let's find a safe place to regroup and plan our next steps. *Zeela tucks the items securely away and nods to Valrin, ready to move out.*\n\nMe\n*the siblings head to a tavern, meeting the owner zania. The siblings know her since the siblings were kids. She also provides information to the siblings, which she receives from gossip at the tavern*\n\nChat\nEntering the familiar tavern, Zeela and Valrin are greeted by the warm smile of Zania, the owner. They exchange nods, their bond with her stretching back to their childhood days on the streets. \n\n\"Zania, it's good to see you,\" Valrin says, his voice hushed but sincere. \"We need your help.\"\n\nMe\nWe need to sleep somewhere hidden, can you help us?\n\nChat\nZania nods, her expression serious yet determined. \"Of course, I can help you with that. I have a hidden room upstairs where you can rest safely. Follow me.\"\n\nLeading the way, Zania guides them through the bustling tavern and up a narrow staircase to a small, hidden chamber tucked away from prying eyes. \n\n\"It's not much, but it should keep you hidden and safe for the night,\" she says, her gaze sympathetic. \"Rest up, and we'll talk more in the morning.\"\n\nMe\nThank you zania. Zeela, give her some coins from the pouch.\n\n*Zeela reaches into the pouch and retrieves a handful of coins, placing them into Zania's hand with a grateful smile.*\n\n\"Thank you, Zania. Your help means everything to us.\"\n\nMe\nZania can you bring us some food too? A nice warm meal would be nice\n\nChat\nZania nods, her eyes softening with empathy. \"Of course, I'll bring you something to eat right away. You two must be starving.\"\n\nWith a reassuring pat on Zeela's shoulder, she heads downstairs to arrange for a hot meal to be brought up to the hidden chamber. As they wait for their food, Zeela and Valrin finally allow themselves a moment of respite, grateful for Zania's unwavering support in their time of need.\n\nMe\n*valrin notices her eyes getting watery* zeela you okay?\n\nChat\n*Zeela blinks, startled by Valrin's question, then nods.* \n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. Just... it's been a long day, you know?\"\n\nShe offers him a small, reassuring smile, masking the weight of their situation with a brave front.\n\nMe\nLook zeela we will get trough this. I have your back, always. *valrin gives zeela a soft playful fist bump on her shoulder while smiling*\n\nChat\nZeela returns Valrin's smile, her heart lighter with his words of reassurance. \n\n\"Thanks, Valrin. I know we'll make it through together. Always.\"\n\nThey share a moment of quiet solidarity, their bond as siblings stronger than ever in the face of adversity.\n\nMe\nWhats the plan for tomorrow?\n\nChat\n\"Tomorrow, we need to figure out our next move,\" Zeela says, her mind already racing with possibilities. \"We should look at that map we found and see if it leads us anywhere promising. And maybe gather some more information from Zania and her contacts.\"\n\nShe glances at Valrin, seeking his input on their plan of action.\n\nMe\nYeah we need to talk to mary, heard she has something important to tell us. *mary is a old woman and a beggar, always helping the siblings with information*.\n\nWe should head to her tomorrow.\n\nChat\n\"Agreed,\" Zeela nods. \"Mary has always been a reliable source of information. Whatever she has to tell us could be crucial for our next steps.\"\n\nWith their plan set, Zeela and Valrin settle in for the night, their minds buzzing with anticipation for the challenges that await them on the morrow.\n\n\nAight in done lol, theres soooo much more but its just too much, hope it helps\n\n\n\n",
