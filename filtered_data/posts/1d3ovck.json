    "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nSoon there is the voting election for the EU. Of course there are multiple sites available supporting in the decision but they seem mostly to rely on answers given by a questionnaire to the specific party, but not how they acted in the past. I\u2019m just wondering if it is a valid attempt to use ChatGPT for it, let\u2019s call it Vote-O-GTP. German folks may notice now where my attempt is coming from ;)\n\nTherefore, what do you think? Do you see anything what needs to be improved? I\u2019m not planning to publish it on any website beside here and use it just for personal reasons. I\u2019m always overwhelmed by the available options on the election.\n\nHere is the prompt I have so far:\n\nI want to create a voting assistant for the EU elections. Here are my requirements:\n1. Target audience: General voters.\n2. Topic areas: General political topics.\n3. Considered parties: All major EU parties.\n4. Detail level of evaluations: Summary of key points.\n5. Number of questions: Flexible, default is 20.\n6. Question types: Mix of Yes/No questions, multiple-choice, and scale questions.\n7. Results presentation: Percentage match.\n8. Evaluation basis: Voting behavior of parties first, followed by expert opinions, then party programs.\n9. Interactivity: The voting assistant should be interactive to better evaluate follow-up questions.\n10. Technical requirements: No special requirements, just provision here in the chat.\n\nAdditionally, the voting assistant should:\n- Allow multiple choices for some questions to better capture nuances in political views.\n- Include more specific questions about current topics and debates.\n- Have interactive follow-up questions based on previous answers.\n- Enable weighting of answers to consider the importance of individual questions.\n- Provide detailed explanations of matches and concrete examples from the parties' voting records of the last year\n- Offer feedback options to improve future versions.\n- allow further details in the answer\n- Support multiple languages.\n- Consider smaller and less well-known parties.\n- Include questions about minority rights and diversity issues.\n- Clearly explain the evaluation basis.\n- state in the final recommendation the timestamp of your last data\n\nPlease ask me 20 questions to determine my political preferences.",
