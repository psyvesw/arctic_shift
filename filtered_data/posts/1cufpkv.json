    "selftext": "Provided that you get an API key and set up your account correctly with Google, it is possible to create a Custom GPT with an action that makes a request to Gemini. I recommend to keep that Custom GPT private, unless you want to pay Google for others to use your API key.\n\nDownsides to this use case:\n\n* ChatGPT doesn't output the raw reply given by Gemini, though it can if requested to do so in the prompt (*\"give Gemini's answer 'as is', then...\"*).\n* The user can only guide the prompt given by ChatGPT to Gemini, which can be rather short.\n* I'm not sure if it would be possible to send long conversations to Gemini, though I haven't tested further customizing the GPT to give it the instruction to do so.\n\nOne interesting element: it's still a discussion with ChatGPT, so it's possible to iterate and ask to submit new elements to Gemini.\n\nHere is the openapi schema used for the action, created with the help of ChatGPT. I'm not an expert with openapi, all I wanted to was to create this proof of concept, and I'm happy it works. I guess that by having an openapi definition that includes a more complex structure for the request, allowing to send a conversation with roles and texts, the use case could be made more complex.\n\nThe API key header is custom, with the name of the parameter being \"X-goog-api-key\".\n\n    openapi: 3.0.0\n    info:\n      title: Google Gemini API\n      description: API for interacting with the Google Gemini generative language models.\n      version: 1.0.0\n    servers:\n      - url: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta\n        description: Main API server\n    paths:\n      /models/gemini-pro:generateContent:\n        post:\n          operationId: generateContent\n          summary: Generate content using the Gemini model\n          requestBody:\n            required: true\n            content:\n              application/json:\n                schema:\n                  type: object\n                  properties:\n                    contents:\n                      type: array\n                      items:\n                        type: object\n                        properties:\n                          parts:\n                            type: array\n                            items:\n                              type: object\n                              properties:\n                                text:\n                                  type: string\n                  required:\n                    - contents\n          responses:\n            \"200\":\n              description: Successful response with generated content\n              content:\n                application/json:\n                  schema:\n                    type: object\n                    properties:\n                      candidates:\n                        type: array\n                        items:\n                          type: object\n                          properties:\n                            parts:\n                              type: array\n                              items:\n                                type: object\n                                properties:\n                                  text:\n                                    type: string\n                      prompt_feedback:\n                        type: object\n                        properties:\n                          safety_ratings:\n                            type: array\n                            items:\n                              type: object\n                              properties:\n                                category:\n                                  type: string\n                                probability:\n                                  type: string\n            \"400\":\n              description: Bad request, usually due to invalid input parameters\n            \"401\":\n              description: Unauthorized, usually due to invalid or missing API key\n            \"500\":\n              description: Internal server error\n\nAnd here is an example of answer given by ChatGPT.\n\nPrompt:\n\n>In English, in one single request give Gemini your definition of Human Consciousness and request its analysis and own definition, as if you were asking a feedback by making the request with the following structure: here is my definition, what is your opinion about it, what is your own definition.

Consciousness encompasses various mental processes, including perception, cognition, and reflection. What is your opinion about it? What is your own definition?\" } ] } ]\n\nChatGPT reply:\n\n# Analysis of Gemini's Reply\n\n>\n\n>**Opinion on Your Definition:**\n\n>\n\n>Gemini acknowledges that my definition captures several key aspects of human consciousness. It commends the inclusion of:\n\n>- **Self-awareness:** Recognizing one's own existence.\n\n>- **Mental Processes:** Including perception, cognition, and reflection.\n\n>- **Interaction with the Environment:** Understanding and interacting with surroundings.\n\n>\n\n>Gemini appreciates the reflexive nature of my definition, highlighting its acknowledgment of the diverse functions associated with consciousness.\n\n>\n\n>**Gemini's Alternative Definition:**\n\n>\n\n>1. **Subjectivity and Qualia:**\n\n>   - **Qualia:** Unique internal states, emotions, and sensations.\n\n>2. **Integration and Processing:**\n\n>   - Combining sensory inputs, thoughts, and memories into a coherent experience.\n\n>   - Processing and interpreting information from internal and external sources.\n\n>3. **Cognitive Control:**\n\n>   - Exerting control over thoughts, actions, and attention.\n\n>   - Enabling planning, decision-making, and behavior regulation.\n\n>4. **Self-Awareness and Metacognition:**\n\n>   - Recognizing and reflecting on one's own mental states.\n\n>   - Metacognitive awareness allows monitoring thoughts, feelings, and intentions.\n\n>5. **Phenomenal Awareness:**\n\n>   - Subjective experience of the world.\n\n>   - Perceiving and understanding objects, events, and relationships in the environment.\n\n>\n\n# My Analysis of Gemini's Reply\n\n>\n\n>Gemini's reply enriches my understanding of human consciousness by introducing additional elements and emphasizing certain aspects more thoroughly:\n\n>\n\n>- **Subjectivity and Qualia:** While my definition mentions experiencing thoughts and emotions, Gemini emphasizes the unique internal states (qualia) which provide a deeper understanding of subjective experiences.\n\n>- **Integration and Processing:** This aspect extends my definition by focusing on how consciousness integrates various sensory inputs and thoughts into a coherent whole.\n\n>- **Cognitive Control:** Gemini highlights the importance of control over cognitive processes, such as attention and decision-making, which are implicit in my definition but not explicitly mentioned.\n\n>- **Self-Awareness and Metacognition:** Gemini's inclusion of metacognition (thinking about one's own thinking) adds a layer of complexity and introspection that enhances my definition.\n\n>- **Phenomenal Awareness:** The idea of phenomenal awareness (subjective experience of the world) aligns with my definition but is articulated with more nuance by Gemini.\n\n>\n\n# Does Gemini's Reply Change My Definition?\n\n>\n\n>Gemini's response provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of human consciousness. While my original definition is accurate and covers essential aspects, Gemini's definition expands on these points, offering a richer and more comprehensive perspective. Therefore, I would integrate these insights into my own definition as follows:\n\n>\n\n>**Revised Definition:**\n\n>Human consciousness is the state of being aware of and able to think about one's own existence, thoughts, and surroundings. It involves self-awareness, the ability to experience unique internal states (qualia), and the capacity to integrate and process sensory inputs, thoughts, and memories into a coherent experience. Consciousness encompasses various mental processes, including perception, cognition, reflection, and metacognition, allowing for subjective experience, cognitive control, and meaningful interaction with the environment.",
