    "selftext": "With the rise of AI in search and research tasks, I find myself moving away from the term and simply stating, \"I need to research that.\"\n\nMe to AI: Did people used to use \"google\" as a verb for searching? Where before Google, they would say \"I need to search that?\"\n\nAI: Yes, the term \u201cgoogle\u201d has indeed been used as a verb for searching on the internet. The act of using the Google search engine became colloquially known as \u201cgoogling.\u201d Due to the dominance of the Google search engine, \u201cto google\u201d became a transitive verb, referring to searching for information on the World Wide Web, typically using the Google search engine.\n\nThe American Dialect Society chose \u201cgoogle\u201d as the \u201cmost useful word of 2002,\u201d and it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary on June 15, 2006, and to the eleventh edition of the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary in July 2006. The first recorded usage of \u201cgoogle\u201d as a gerund was by Google co-founder Larry Page himself, who wrote on a mailing list: \u201cHave fun and keep googling!\u201d on July 8, 1998. Its earliest known use as an explicitly transitive verb on American television was in the \u201cHelp\u201d episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (October 15, 2002), when Willow asked Buffy, \"Have you googled her yet?\".\n\nBefore the term \u201cgoogle\u201d became synonymous with internet searching, people would use phrases like \u201cI need to search that\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll look it up online.\u201d The verb \u201cgoogle\u201d became so popular that it started to replace the generic term \u201csearch\u201d when referring to looking up information on the internet. However, Google has discouraged the use of the word as a verb, particularly when used as a synonym for general web searching, to prevent the loss of its trademark.",
