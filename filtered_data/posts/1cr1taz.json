    "selftext": "I don't know about you but I am tired of being told AI isn't my voice. I give AI my thoughts and and it helps me articulate them broadly and accessibly.\n\nI'm sure there are those who blindly copy and paste but that's not everyone. Most of us toil with the AI prompts to get it to reflect our own feelings and opinions on a subject matter. It also levels the playing feel making education equitable for a broader spectrum of people.\n\nPlus while you're in the feedback loop with AI you are mastering your subject matter. So even though it wrote it for you.  You know and learned exactly what it wrote. \n\nIt's like these people want to keep writing binary by hand or using pencils instead of using a higher level language to get stuff done. AI gives writing form, structure and accessibility. It needs to be audited, reviewed and understood before being shared. The end product is an AI produced result that reflects my opinions, ideas, hence my voice! \n\nWhat makes me even more bewildered is that my writing style before AI was always serious casual and informative anyway! So there really isn't much difference between what I would have written and the AI. Also I know my subject matter very well before AI became a big thing so these novel ideas it generates aren't even that novel to me to begin with. \n\nI think that AI isn't your voice is a really poor argument against the use of AI. \n\nJust FYI.\n\nI have never been accused of using it or anything I just see policies starting to reflect this verbiage and think it's grasping for straws.
