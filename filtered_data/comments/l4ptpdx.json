    "body": "Here is how I see that. Firstly define lazy and yourself why are people lazy? My conclusion is that modern \"laziness\" is in reality post nihilism and wide spread depression due to abhorrent material conditions. Humans, psychologically, aim to produce and set goals, why else would laziness be a negative term if not to describe a behavior opposed to the expected one. Even this is putting it crudely. \n\n  \nThen ask yourself, where do those kids come from, why the differing behavior? I surmised those who use AI to accelerate their personal growth either were raised in good conditions thus adopted healthier behaviors as humans or were raised in bad conditions and must use their intelligence as a \"a way out\".  \n\nThose who use AI to \"coast by\" seem to be those who use our modern education system to follow a path laid out that seems to solve all their problems or attend to meet cultural expectations. In short, these people care more about the product of their education rather than the knowledge itself. Those who need a way out would also use ai to \"coast by\" but in doing so the latter, in both scenarios, will always become smarter.",
