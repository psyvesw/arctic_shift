    "body": "I honestly wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if we start seeing LLM integration with Siri, and it makes sense that Apple would opt to put resources into designing an intelligent tiny model in order to bring this to existing Apple products without sacrificing much performance and battery life. \n\nAnd running on-device will be a selling point due  to apples privacy marketing, then perhaps the newer iPhones will include a beefier processor and bigger battery to support an even bigger model, or even a separate onboard processor similar to the Vision Pro. \n\nHeck, maybe Siri integration won\u2019t happen right away and they\u2019ll create a separate chat app to test the models on the public first and call it something like \u201cBrainstorm\u201d or something like that. And of course they won\u2019t use terms like \u201cLLM\u201d and \u201cAI\u201d, they\u2019ll call it something like \u201ca machine learning app\u201d or \u201cImprovements to Siri using on-board machine learning\u201d. Meanwhile I imagine integration with Google and Microsoft products will continue with them just selling hardware with licenses to connect to their respective cloud LLMs.",
