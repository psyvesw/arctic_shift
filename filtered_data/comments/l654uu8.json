    "body": ">I don't know why people underestimate Google so much, when chatGPT was released, it was supposed to replace search, yet search has only grown and Google's revenue is at an all time high. Also, people see Google only as a search engine and web browser. What about photos, maps, Android, YouTube, email, GCP, Google workspace, Google Education suite, Chromebooks, Google TV etc.\n\nThat wasn't people underestimating google, but overestimating ChatGPT. It wasn't going to replace search, the use cases for ChatGPT and Google are just different. And also, the thing is, the majority of Google's revenue comes from ads in google search (not YouTube or other), so search is definitely a very important part of Googles business.",
