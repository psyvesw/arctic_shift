    "body": "It\u2019s tough because I don\u2019t ever have any actual proof - Turnitin is not good at picking up on this kind of thing and our uni currently isn\u2019t using it for AI detection, so it\u2019s just me thinking \u201cthis feels like chat gpt\u201d and obviously I can\u2019t flag a student for that. And even if you heavily suspect and report it, the main AI academic integrity team usually comes back with the same thing and it\u2019s just a huge waste of time. \n\nGenerally though, assignments where AI has clearly been used and not reworked score lower than assignments where it\u2019s clear a person wrote them. The language is more accurate and more concise, they meet specific aspects of the marking rubric that AI would overlook, and they *do it the way we have taught them in class*. \n\nIn the end, if a student asks chat gpt to write their assignment but then goes through it and cleans it up, rewrites bits, ensures it meets the rubric and guide and follows what they\u2019ve been taught, makes sure they\u2019re expanding in areas weighted more heavily and generally just follows instructions, I don\u2019t really care because they\u2019re learning anyway. Most of the time though, they don\u2019t do that.",
