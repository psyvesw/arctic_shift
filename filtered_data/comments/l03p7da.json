    "body": "I'm a photo retoucher. What gives it away to me it's how smooth everything is, and it's all the same, they all look the same, they're all wearing the same jeans, same boots, similar t'shirts, which have similar folds, and similar dirt patterns, and all hats with no logos. And on the floor there's nothing like some small piece of garbage, dead leaf, piece of paper, it's all too clean. Unless it's a photo that was very retouched, the chances of all these things happening all at the same time on their own, would be a massive coincidence. Could be a real photo taken from an ad,, that would explain the heavy retouching the clean floor and the ppl & clothes synchronization.\n\n But what's weird is the dirt pattern on them. Their stains are way too smooth, too uniform. There's no splatters, or spots in other places, there's no small wrinkles or creases. Even with the low resolution of the photo, there should be some more things visible on their clothes. Also their skin looks too clean. Even with the low resolution, there should be things like a spot here and there, or redness.\n\nI would incline to say it's AI, but it's also possible it could be a heavily retouched photo from an ad (now what ad could this be for...beats me...but I've seen all sorts of ads in my life, i wouldn't olace it out of the realm of possibility).",
