    "body": "To be fair, this does follow most models for an apology. Therapists use similar models with their clients to help them acknowledge what they did and think about their actions. \n\nHarvard Health has an article of the art of a heartfelt apology. This could be the reason it sounds so structured. The person could be concerned with getting it right and not making things worse. \n\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-art-of-a-heartfelt-apology-2021041322366#:~:text=Acknowledge%20the%20offense.,the%20victim%20was%20really%20hurt.\n\nIn the future though, if I were OP, I would avoid doing any type of project or group work with this person. If they are using AI when it is not allowed or outright plagiarizing because of their lack of being able to put in the proper work, OP doesn't want that attached to their name too. It could have some serious consequences for their academic career as a student.",
