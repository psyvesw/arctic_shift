    "body": "I work for a very large multilateral organization and have to read lengthy reports or meandering email threads. When not much is at stake, I\u2019ll get ChatGPT to summarise them for me (saves me a tonne of time per week). When reporting stuff, I would just jot down my ideas (contextual information) and ask the LLM to thread it into my preferred format (paragraph or point form) and then read it for customisation before sending. Again, a lot of time is saved. Helps with my critical reading of draft reports and stuff as well. I\u2019d upload and ask for recommendations for improvement and it would spit out things that I either couldn\u2019t think or would require an inordinate amount of time of research to find by myself. Personally, I think ChatGPT has largely replaced Wikipedia for me as I can get extremely focused information on precisely what I want to know instead of peripheral stuff I don\u2019t care about. I do this for my scientific curiosities as well but unless it\u2019s for work, I don\u2019t check its sources (4o is somewhat better but it still hallucinates facts so I\u2019m wary of this even when I do research for fun).",
