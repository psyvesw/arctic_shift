    "body": ">claude claimed it was extremely straightforward and that decoding it was beyond trivial for an llm\n\nNormally, I'd say don't believe anything an LLM says about what it can and can't do, but Claude 3 might actually have been trained to accurately say what it can and can't do. The first version of ChatGPT from 2022, when asked about its capabilities, would frequently say that, as an LLM, it may make grammatical mistakes (which it basically never did).\n\nAlso, decoding and encoding in base64 is only hard for LLMs because they work in tokens, NOT characters or bytes or whatever (yes, some LLMs are trained on bytes and images, etc., but ChatGPT, as used in OP's screenshot, works with text based tokens). As far as I'm aware, no LLM has been trained to actually understand this limitation. They may mention tokens and tokenizers and claim to know all about this, but that doesn't mean anything they output will really reflect their \"understanding\" (they won't know when to second guess themselves when it comes to things like spelling, or any subword / character-level tasks, which is very difficult for LLMs to learn because of tokenization).",
