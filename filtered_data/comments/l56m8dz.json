    "body": "Yes definitely be wary of it hallucinating, which it did a couple of times during my studies. My strategy was that I watched Jason Dion's course on Udemy, which comes with a several practice exams. After getting a general overview by watching the class all the way through, I went to the practice exams. Every question I got that I didn't understand I would screenshot and immediately put it into ChatGPT and ask it what the correct answer was and to explain it. I would ask as many followup questions as I needed in order to feel like I truly understood the concept, then moved on to the next question. At the end of the practice exams, you can review all of your mistakes and it gives an explanation for why it was wrong - that's how I verified / caught any hallucinations (but there were literally only like two or three times it was wrong). I went through every practice exam, reviewed concepts I didn't know or that I was getting wrong, and basically just took them one after the other until I was scoring 80%+ on all of them. Then I took the exam and passed! Also remember you don't need a perfect score to get the cert - a pass is a pass regardless of your score.",
