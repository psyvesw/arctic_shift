    "body": "Free will is already a scientifically meaningless concept which persists as a belief because it promotes personal responsibility and the ability to demand responsibility from other humans, both of which are vital cogs in the clockwork of humanity on both an individual or species level. Societies that believe in free will are more functional than those which do not. The reality of the thing itself is irrelevant.\n\nWhether or not that belief is extended to AI as well depends on the position AI takes in our society. If it is a tool it is better to see it as not having free will, allowing that responsibility to fall solely on its creators or users. If it is a person it is better to see it as having free will and also to teach it responsibility for its own actions.\n\nIf an AI appears to think like a human, it is just as worthy of being ascribed free will as we are.",
