    "body": "Honestly? You ask AI this question. \n\nAI gets better every day and eventually it will be able to do a lot of things by itself. But right now one of the biggest things is that AI can teach you and guide you through doing nearly anything.\n\nLots of people have been saying how with AI the they've created their first app, website, or game, without any experience. The trick is you still need some personal skill - the ability to ask questions, teach yourself, trial and error, the skills of curiosity and learning.\n\nBut if you had the skills and motivation to self-teach before, using videos and guides etc to figure out new things, AI is a tool that makes all of that like exponentially faster. It can read giant error logs and help you solve problems. It can help you come up with ideas, turn ideas into detailed plans, tell you what kind of tools you'll need to work on those plans, and help you learn to use those tools. It can write good code, or manipulate and analyze data, or write creatively for marketing/fun, etc. \n\nSo go to Chat GPT or Claude, by my recommendations those are the best right now. And just talk to them like advisors. Let the AI help you explore your skills and interests and possible ways you could start using AI.",
