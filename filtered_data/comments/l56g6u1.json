    "body": "Mainly just work and study. For work I use it to write professional emails, and a bunch of other stuff here and there when I'm stuck or have to go through a large document. For study I use chatGPT to compile and organize notes by key points, help in preparing a script for assignments, presentations, etc.\n\nAside from that I have used chatGPT to translate novels. Its better than google translate because it tries to make sense of the story. I have used it for coding, I don't know how to code, never learned it, so chatGPT is great when I need to write some codes.\n\nThat's about it I think. I don't see anything else in my history aside from these (other than some chats where I was just testing the limits and capabilities of chatGPT).",
