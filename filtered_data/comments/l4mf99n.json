    "body": "I've used GPT 3.5 until mid 2023 and the difference between that and Claude at the time was huuuuge, especially for my use case, I'm writing a novel and Claude was brilliant, I had to teach it exactly my style, but it replicated that to the T and came up with so much usable shit I could just put it in the novel as is, it was that good.\n\nThen I switched to Gemini, and the difference was, again, crazy. I taught it the same stuff the way I did Claude but it came up with \"cooler\" more \"sleek\" writing, Gemini felt like a brash writer, coming up with The Fight Club like bold writing and more punchy dialogue like the antiheroes of today, and Claude felt like F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby in comparison, a historical literature classic but it was quite high brow a lot of the time and it got stuck with repeating certain ideas and motifs over and over again, quality shit, but I was beginning to see repetition.\n\nI used Gemini both ways, and it could do exactly what Claude did, but also what it couldn't, make more modern dialogue, nuanced like Claude but more contemporary and WITH ZERO OVERSIGHT, there's not been a single time it ever said to me \"nah I won't do it, against the guidelines\"\n\nWhereas with Claude, it was moral lecturing and virtue signalling every other prompt, I found my way around it but it still took time so Gemini was the best of both worlds to me + 2TB cloud storage + Integration with docs/sheets/youtube \n\nAND IT WAS CHEAPER (because in my country they collect tax after the $20 subscription making it close to $24)\n\nSo for me, it made no sense to stick to Claude anymore. \n\nBut I've never tried GPT4 myself, maybe it can go neck and neck with both?",
