    "body": ">If, let's say, half the population loses their jobs, wtf do you think is going to happen to the economy? It's going to collapse.\n\nThis is absolutely wrong. In this hypothetical scenario you are painting, you are ignoring the fact that the jobs of those who are laid off are still being performed. The work is still getting done and the employers will not only remain productive, but they will be immensely more efficient as well. Obviously your immediate counter argument is to say \u201cwell if that many people are laid off, then nobody will be able to afford to purchase the goods\u201d. Yet this would be a fallacy argument as well. Sure there will be an initial reduction in demand as unemployment increases. In a recessionary environment producers will reduce prices which they will be able to afford thanks to their huge boost in production efficiency. Those that are laid off will begin to find new opportunities of employment. Some will take advantage of new technologies to start businesses of their own. They will hire employees as necessary to run these new businesses. Many of the more qualified employees will find new opportunities elsewhere. Those who have the least skills and education will certainly be hurt the most. Yet some of those will pursue higher education or new fields of employment. Blue collar job fields which are unable to be performed by AI technology will see a mass influx of new applicants seeking employment. The shortage of labor in those areas will decrease. As the economy recovers the cost of living will decrease as prices begin to find their new equilibrium and society as a whole will eventually be better off. We see this time and time again every time throughout our history when there has been a dramatic technological evolution. People improvise, adapt, and overcome.",
