    "body": "I'm being incredibly honest when I say AI is missing the human tendency to \"story top\", make things about themselves, brush off the concerns and feelings of others, and lacking empathy and compassion. AI does it all, and so many of us don't. \n\nNo joke, and I'm not saying all people are like this because there are awesome people all over, but a lot of people are very self centered in their own experiences and opinions, and very closed off to the possible experiences and emotions of others. Very individualized and apathetic to anything outside our little spheres of existence. \n\nBesides the obvious restrictions put in place to keep AI \"safe\", I'd say when it comes to being supportive, AI has us beat. If we're basing AI behavior on values and good character, they're more human than we are. Whatever being \"human\" even means. Just my opinion of course.",
