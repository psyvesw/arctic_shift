    "body": "It just comes down to available time. The people doing this stuff do it full time and have the luxury of trying and experimenting and working with a bunch of other people trying to solve the same problem. No one person made all this happen nor understands every aspect of it in full, even the devs that wrote the code. And it didn't happen overnight. They've been working on it for years. So you can't expect you, one person, to know it in that same level of detail having your own job that isn't AI, a life outside of work, etc. You can learn it, but are you willing and able to devote the time needed to do so?",
