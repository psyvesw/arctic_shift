    "body": "100% this. There are way more next-gen ai tools out there that are not chat gpt and I have personally found Grammarly 1000000 times better than chat gpt for helping me write. Chat gpt is good for general stuff, but for writing at the graduate level for something as incredibly specific as a master's thesis just causes it to trip up and fail.\n\nBut there is hope for chat gpt in it's python style spinoffs which are just like python kits, I found one that's similar to a souped up Google search for scientific papers, which is fantastic. But there is one problem: it's a for-profit model that has a costly subscription and I could use only the free trial version. Who's gonna pay for that? My school? Sorry but I'm from a low tier school on the verge of bankruptcy. It's very sad that the for profit model is dominating these new ai tools .",
