    "body": "Isn't it saying \"it will get better\" predicting the future as well? I'm confused.\n\nLook im not saying it won't of course it will, but what is with the sycophantic behavior about something that is destroying an art form?\n\nAs someone who doesn't make film, I can see how you would be excited that \"now anyone can do it.\" But I'm here to tell you A- it won't look or feel the same and B- most people with ideas can't tell a story. The future of film production is what...no production? Do you want me to cheer and clap? I don't think that's a good thing. I like working on sets. Aside from the thousands of talented people that will lose their jobs (and have been) because they work in the grip, or the camera department-- jobs they have worked very hard to get, I think it's the ultimate tragedy: humans create an art form, let it flourish, only to hand it off to a fucking algorithm because: SAviNg moNeY. \n\nAi as a tool for filmmaking is fine. Ai as the outright creator and generator of the image and footage, fucking terrible.",
