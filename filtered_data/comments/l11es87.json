    "body": "ChatGPT's response to conversation screenshot: In AI language models, mentioning a specific word like \"elephant\" activates a network of associations, and the command \"no\" or \"not\" doesn't necessarily negate these activations in the way we intend. This is because the model has been trained on a vast array of text where the presence of the word \u201celephant\u201d is strongly correlated with the actual concept of an elephant, while the signals for negation are much weaker and more abstract.\n\nHuman brains are capable of nuanced understanding and can easily switch contexts to understand negation. But AI, at least in its current state, tends to give weight to the most prominent and frequently occurring concepts in a prompt. It's a challenge of context and emphasis that's quite difficult for AI to navigate. AI developers are working on these kinds of problems, aiming to teach models to better understand and respond to the subtleties of human language, including negation.",
