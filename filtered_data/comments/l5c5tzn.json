    "body": "I don't care if this is a joke post, either way I want to respond to it earnestly.\n\nMy understanding of the TOS is that it's focused more on stopping people from doing dangerous and/or illegal things. They're more worried about terrorists than coomers. Next down the list is probably the kinds of bugs that Replika users had to deal with, i.e. their \"AI girlfriend\" being uncharacteristically mean after having formed trusting bonds with them. Next down from that i think is maintaining a respectable reputation in a society that lock up their spirits, drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets. \n\nI have no idea what i'm talking about and am purely speculating based on my concept of OpenAI as a company and my experience using their products, i'm not a paralegal or a lawyer or a legal scholar this is not legal advice.\n\nAlso relevant, the p0rn site adultTime has a beta AI roleplay section. It's alright. it would definitely try to do what you're asking for but it probably won't be as smart about it. I don't know what LLM it uses but i would guess it's the GPT 3.5 API",
