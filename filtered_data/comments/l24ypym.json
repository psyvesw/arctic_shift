    "body": "I mean, there is a good chance that we just get to the point where we do rely on tools like ChatGPT for everything, the same way we use our phones or the internet for a lot. \nBooks are read a lot less than now, than they used to be, and that\u2019s not because they are less helpful or less enjoyable, it\u2019s just that the internet or watching a video is easier, it\u2019s still entertainment or educational, just easier.\nI think Ai will start to become more of given over time and it may cause you to know less yourself, because you won\u2019t need to know so much, if everyone has access to the same thing, they will all be educated as much as they need and the ai will do the rest. It will end up being kinda like you don\u2019t need to know it all, ai knows it all, you just know some, but it\u2019s not just you it\u2019s every other programmer out there.\n\nThat\u2019s a little long winded, but it\u2019s my two cents \ud83d\ude2d",
