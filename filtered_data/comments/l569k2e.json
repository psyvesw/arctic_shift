    "body": "Wow! Great use. I vacationed in Moab, Utah a few years back, and I downloaded an app that you could load a (cowboy with a southern drawl, which was strange considering the geographic location, lol) prerecorded history lesson about the site of interest. While that was neat at the time, it was also kind of annoying that you could only get so much information. I love that, if you were so inclined, you could probe for more details using ChatGPT and get a real-time response to your questions, building on what you already know about the area and giving further insight into how the locations connected culturally to each other. This is such a fabulous use case. Thanks for sharing this idea!",
