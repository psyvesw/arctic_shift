    "body": "**Research project on LLM-usage in the workplace**  \n  \nHi, I hope it's appropriate to post the following (my apologies if not!). We are looking for people to participate in a semi-structured interview to ask about how they are using LLMs in their day to day work. Specifically, we are looking for people who regularly use LLMs to complete work-related tasks, and are especially interested if people have developed pipelines or automated tasks that involve LLMs in their work. The interview is part of a non-profit research project conducted by Rethink Priorities. The interview will take place online (via Zoom) and will take about 50-60 minutes. We are offering $100 for your participation. If you want to know more, or if you want to participate, please contact me at [willem@rethinkpriorities.org](mailto:willem@rethinkpriorities.org) so that we can assess your eligibility.",
