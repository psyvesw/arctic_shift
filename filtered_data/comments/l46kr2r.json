You can get right to the main things that interest you ---- and save time for what you really want to do.\n\nIf you or a child is studying for school or doing some work task, use the AI to help solve problems, look up facts, or just inspire you about something.\n\nIf you know a phrase, but not quite what it means, ask AI for a translation and several usages. It's a snap.\n\nIf you're a lawyer or doctor and have access to professional sources of information, ask AI your questions about a patient or blood test or about some unusual disease and its symptoms, use the AI and the sources to have it search for and summarize the information for you.\n\nThere are many more possibilities.",
