    "body": ">It speeds up my work, and the work of a few others I know personally. My damn CEO uses it! If it can speed up advanced jobs like this then you really don't think it would help less difficult jobs? really?\n \nThink of all the people that work in shops, restaurants, cafes, bars, customer facing jobs in banks, teachers that don't spend significant amounts of time creating their own resources etc. etc.\n\nThere are (currently) very limited applications for significantly speeding up their daily work using LLMs. \n\nI think people that work with computers and whose days are spent producing paperwork can overestimate how many other people spend their days doing such.\n\nThis morning I had a class at my local swimming pool, got a coffee and took a bus to work and am about to head to a restaurant for lunch. Very few of the people I've interacted could find any benefit from using ChatGPT for the bulk of their work.",
