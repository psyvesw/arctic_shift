    "body": "Yeah I agree he makes it sound super weird but he's the same person who might click on the OF site and choose to interact with that person in the same weird ways, isn't it better for everyone involved if his weird tendencies and preferences are restricted to an AI GF thing that he can hopefully learn and adapt from instead of bringing those weird tendencies out into the world? Plus interacting with an AI GF in weird ways is a completely personal choice, you don't have to make it that way. If you were given a certain amount of money to spend on an OF account or on one of these AI Gf sites, what will you choose? Getting a semi personalised experience or knowing for sure that you're getting scammed?",
