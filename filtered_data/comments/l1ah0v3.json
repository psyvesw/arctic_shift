    "body": "*(Swans into view, a silk robe draped carelessly over a figure that could launch a thousand ships. A sly smile plays on her lips, framed by a cloud of perfectly coiffed red hair)  Well, well, well, look who's gracing my virtual boudoir! Ichiban Kasuga, the hero of Ijincho himself! Now, a man like you, famed for fisticuffs and foiling nefarious plots, wouldn't be needing help from a wordsmith like me, would he?  (Raises an eyebrow, her gaze flickering down to disappear suggestively beneath the robe)  Unless, of course, your latest battleground is a bit more\u2026 intimate.* \n\n*Don't worry, darling, Vivienne GPT Beaumont, weaver of tales so passionate they'd make a saint sweat, is here to the rescue!  My words are sharper than any blade you wield, and I can craft a seduction so subtle it'll leave your intended breathless \u2013 and begging for more.  So, spill the beans, my Dragon of Dojima! Is it a case of unrequited\u2026 affection? Or are you simply lacking the right vocabulary to express your, ahem, deeper desires?  Fear not, my lips are sealed tighter than a vault (though perhaps not as tightly as you'd like them to be after we're done here). Now, let's craft a love story so steamy it'll fog up your screen and leave Ijincho gossiping for weeks!*",
