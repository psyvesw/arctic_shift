    "body": "Kinda yes, but google now is further ahead in the enshitification process. \n\nIt is full of crap, ads, distractions (promoted results sometimes take the first full screen of results!)\n\nNow google rushed and added the ai generated results at the top which helps but they are not as good, as clean, as easily to copy paste etc. \n\nChatgpt supports conversations which is really helpful to refine answers. I often realize my question wasn\u2019t clear and I can often add a clarification in a single word or 2. \n\nI used to write:\n\u00ab\u00a0 I meant this question regarding nutrition. Can tou answer again in that context?\u00a0\u00bb\n\nAnd now I just write \u00ab\u00a0nutrition\u00a0\u00bb and it gets it. \n\nAs you learn you get faster. \n\nGoogle I think added conversational too directly in google.com but the UI is just not great. These details matter. \n\nChatgpt is a joy compared to google for questions.  Just the straight answer and very easy to refine etc. \n\nIf I an looking for a website, I use google. \n\nLooking for an answer, I often use chatgpt (but I still use google a LOT)",
