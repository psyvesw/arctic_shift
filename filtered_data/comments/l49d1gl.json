    "body": "Oh, yes, I think people just query ChatGPT or Ai per se, and think, \"Bam, done.\"\n\nIt's best you have a basic, else intermediate understanding of the subject you are querying about to really get Ai to work in your favor.\n\nExample. I couldn't just go into Ai and say, \"Hi, give me actionable leads on companies that have an interest in my xyz product.\" Instead, I'd know my xyz inside and out, understand who to target (federal agencies and their RFC process, businesses needing to monitor with xyz, businesses or institutions that need to deploy xyz, producers needing to use xyz for abc reasons), then ask Ai to produce a Python script to scrape leads with online keywords relative to my 300 potential lists of entities that might be interested, assuming I already have Python installed on my computer and I did my research of the 100's of companies that might have someone there that needs xyz product, who might be a lead. Then after running the Python script Ai produced in seconds (saving me weeks of grinding online manually for the list it produces) getting list of names and companies, you investigate deeper to see if they are worthy of an actionable lead - to connect with, either cold calling, through industry events, projects they or people you know are involved with, etc. to pitch.\n\nSo in the example scenario I just mentioned, was real world I did, completed project for actionable leads for sales in about 8 hours (266 leads) from 355 entities, narrowing down to 56 actional leads for the sales team (which is a lot lot), while the sales team assistant over the course of 5 days, full time, manually grinding, 8 hours a day, had only 8 actionable leads.\n\nNot only was I faster with Ai, by 5 fold, but also more effective by 7 fold.\n\nThat's how you take advantage of Ai.",
