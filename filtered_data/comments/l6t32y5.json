    "body": "But art is useful? People enjoy it, it\u2019s useful for cultural expression and exchange, it helps record history, it makes communication easier. The font you see now was made by an artist, the ui it\u2019s contained in, the layout of the website any LLM is hosted on, that\u2019s all art too. From the clothing you wear to the books that taught you how to read and write, to the expressions that you use in everyday life those were shaped by art. Any games you play, the advertisements that push on other industries, the building you live in and the things in your home, all collaborative works of art and science. \n\nAnything iconic and recognizable, branding to end product design. From Arizona iced tea\u2019s can to things that shape identities of nations. \nThe woman who designed that can is still alive and still working. Or if I say \u2018patterned paper water cup\u2019 odds are you think of a very specific pattern. Britannia rules the waves is a fairly recognizable phrase, but it only exists because of a poem/song telling Britannia to rule the waves. Robotics and Ai exist because of art. \n\nNo artist can do any of this alone of course. Art\nisn\u2019t the one true thing that makes us human or whatever. However, if art wasn\u2019t useful no one would have ever attempted to automate it.",
