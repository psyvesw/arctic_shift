    "body": "Honestly though...I am a grade school teacher. Some of the hallucinations really remind me of how some of my students answer questions. They will just throw shit out there that came to their mind, have no idea what they said, will defend what they said and will literally believe any correction you give them. I have on particular student who basically answers my questions by throwing out the first association his brain comes up with no matter how little sense it makes in that context. I really want to know what processes are similar here and where they are fundamentally different. I really hope this AI development will help us understand our own intelligence better. I suspect we are a lot more random than we would like to admit too, we just have better guard rails to not let us blurt out random shit that our mind comes up with below.",
