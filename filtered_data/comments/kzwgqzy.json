    "body": "Having a conversation with ChatGPT, in regards to medical terminology and jargon, diagnoses, treatment, etc., can be very empowering. It can serve as a foundation to build questions and engage in conversations at a level that you\u2019re comfortable with. Being able to ask them ChatGPT to put it into Word you understand is so powerful. Having the time to process what is being shared with you, ask, follow up questions, or whatever else, allows us to be a better advocate for our medical care. Too many times in the medical industry are we either gaslighted, provided information at a level beyond our understanding, or just don\u2019t simply give enough thought to the big picture. I use ChatGPT as a speech language pathologist in my own practice, both in the school setting as well as the medical setting, and it has propelled me into becoming a better therapist overall. It allows me to think like the model in how I approach evaluating intriguing my own patients. Furthermore, as it also helps with having conversations about my own medical issues as well as my wife\u2019s. It just result in better care. In my opinion.",
