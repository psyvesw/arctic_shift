    "body": "Like any other new tool, in order for it to be helpful you have to first go out of your way to train with it and learn how it will be helpful for your task in particular.  That takes initial time and effort up front, for a possibility of unknown payoff later.  That sort of choice is a hard sell, most people if they have a thing that works they are going to keep doing what they know works rather than put time and effort into trying new ways of doing it. \n\nAnd also, for a large percentage of jobs there just isn't a way for LLMs to help them much right now.  Some people might use LLMs to move out of one of those jobs into something else, but that will be a small number of people.  I know for my job, there isn't really much it can help me with other than as a slightly more powerful search engine--it can find me more obscure stuff than Google can--but I still have to double check the truth of everything it finds.  Maybe I could use ChatGPT to get a different job, but I don't really want one of those other jobs, my job now works for me.",
