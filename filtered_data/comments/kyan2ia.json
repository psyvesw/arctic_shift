    "body": "> I also think it's a bit presumptive that our experience is, or should be, necessarily governed by happiness. We barely know enough about our own biology to form a cogent argument as to what happiness even is, and I feel for many, many years, or perhaps forever, that argument will be incomplete.\n\nmaybe, but im basing it off the idea that a lot of new technology is certainly *presented* to us by the creators as if its purpose is to increase our happiness (or increase our productivity which will in turn increase our happiness).  also, i don't think we need to understand happiness on a biological level or deeper philosophical level, or whatever vaguely defined level, to form arguments based around it\n\ni certainly agree that human consciousness is a very interesting topic worthy of study and discussion though, in case we find out its not as impossible to understand as it seems\n\n> I also find it a bit ironic that one of the common final conclusions is \"big picture\" when the journey is not one giant step but an overwhelming amount of tiny steps. I see little things like bitching about GPT and desiring for higher quality or more efficiency as being just those tiny steps, and just as important as the bigger picture.\n\nyeah thats a valid interpretation, but i think in order for one to have this perspective, they should still be aware of it enough to elucidate it as you just did.  for some, it seems like they really are only able to grasp one step at a time and are constantly chasing something that is inevitably fleeting but believing it will last. which is one way to live i guess but personally not for me",
