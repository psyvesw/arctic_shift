    "body": "Asking GPT If you are right in any topic will make it say you are right unless obviously wrong. Paraphilia as a topic is extremely hard to discuss because people jump to guns immediatly, thinking that every paraphilic is an abuser by default. Therefore, GPTs, being trained on forums of people, will have similar reactions.  \n\n\nI am surprised to read that having an outlet of paraphilic tendencies in any individual increases those urges instead of controlling them. From what I remember, it is people who already starting abusing others with the paraphilia that are basically a lost cause, just like any addict. But those that don't become abusers due to their moral compass find it easier if there is a victimless alternative they can al\u00edviate their urges with.  \n\n\nSurely, giving alcohol to a psychologically addicted alcoholic will always result in an active alcoholist, even if the alcoholic was rehabilitated. Yet many can consume alcohol without falling in self destructive or outwardly destructive behavior. From what I learned, the same applies for paraphilics. Non touch non abusive paraphilics can use fiction for satiation and control. Abusive ones, instead, even after being rehabilitated, if possible, shouldn't ever come close to it again, and learn to cope without partaking even in fiction of their paraphilia.  \n\n\nIf this becomes a risk vs reward situation, there are red flags you can put on the abusive ones, which usually come with the antisocial disorders they carry beside the paraphilia.",
