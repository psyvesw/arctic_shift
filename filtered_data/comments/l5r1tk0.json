    "body": "It\u2019s exactly this. All of the monetary gain we experience through technological advancement is hoarded by capitalists. Late stage capitalism has no answer for what is happening right now with automation and AI and answering these questions properly is going to determine the fate of millions and millions of people in the coming decades. It\u2019s really scary stuff, especially when you consider who is responsible for policy making in the US, for example. Our politicians are essentially being paid to systematically dismantle any safeguards that would protect the working class\u2019 rights and financial interests. If things continue in the current direction, class war seems not far off.\u00a0",
