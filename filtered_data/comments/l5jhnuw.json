    "body": ">I asked it to analyse all the concerts and events on this page and turn every event into a calendar invite (.ics document) and it failed. It didn\u2019t even get the number of events right. \n\nthis is a task it probably should be able to do, which is turn the page into html and infer what each block of text is, extract title and date and convert that to an .ics friendly format. that it cant is unfortunate, you might have to break down the task. try having it output the events of the page into a simpler format like .csv or .txt, then have it convert that to .ics\n\n>1) Look for all concerts happening in next 6 months, cross-reference it with my music library, if there any any matches, put all the ticket purchase links in a cvs document\n\nall concerts?! everywhere? of any kind??? there are likely hundreds of thousands of concerts every year in britain if you include concerts at small venues/bars (~1000 bars that hold concerts twice a week would be 100,000 concerts conservatively) \n\nand all the data is not going to be located in one place. youre potentially asking it to scour every nook and cranny of the web for hundreds of thousands of concerts to cross check against your music. \n\nyou need to specify and break that task down massively. \n\n>Create me an itinerary for everyday, planned down to the minute\n\nagain, this isnt an issue with AI so much as you are asking for an insanely difficult task. there are likely tons of events occurring in barcelona daily. to have it aribtrarily sort and prioritize them and fit them into one schedule. AND find lunch and dinner AND make a reservation?\n\n>3) Look at all the events happening at dice.fm and ra.co. Create a list of events I can go to for every day there is availability on my google calendar. \n\nthis might be possible if you scoped it better, to a specific city. you might also need to scrape the data yourself or get an api for those websites. chatgpt cant go scraping every website or it will be blacklisted and blocked by every provider because it would be a massive DDOS machine\n\n**some of what you are asking is just totally unscoped. if it could do a crazy task like that, why not just ask it to earn you a million dollars? \"you have a week, heres my bank info, make me a million dollars.\" of course it cannot do that. it can do a lot but you're being unreasonable.**",
