Like I said, I verify what I have to and in my experience, outside of dates and exact names, it's usually pretty good. There's nothing to fear if you already planned on source checking anyways, it's quite good for summaries/overviews.\n\n>It give tons of false information. Like, it's a fucking bullshit machine. It will constantly mess up basic information that can be find on wikipedia. I'm a tech enthusiast but in it's current state, AI is basically just filling the web with false information.\n\nThis is just very overblown. It's correct 80-90% of the time. That's a big failure rate but my goodness you make it sound like the end of the world\n\n>Wanna find new software, ideas, etc.? A reddit post with reply from other user will give you better result.\n\nNo, it will absolutely not, \ud83d\ude06",
