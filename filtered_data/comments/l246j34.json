    "body": "I did try to elaborate on a desire to address a societal defect in that scene. It really sucked because on the characters return to the cell the two were going to escape and the story was really going to get moving. I went through my character descriptions to check for personal subconscious bias that could have potentially spiked up for such a response but my descriptions were fine. Everything I fed it was appropriate and aware and I tried to express the importance of addressing the issue. It just didn't get it. I don't know how else to put it. Chatgpt was beyond colorblind and didn't quite understand it's fault. It just doubled down. I got really frustrated and walked away. If we can't talk about stuff that happens, I don't see how we hope to work on issues at all.\n\nI had plans to address many other issues through the aliens perspective because sometimes society needs to be indirectly corrected and doing so helps to get through the hypersensitivity that often halts productive conversations regarding social and cultural issues. My attempts to explain and even rebuke the llm were unsuccessful. It was like giving a lecture on bioengineering to a 2 year old, which oddly enough is something chatgpt can do really well. These are my two primary characters. The story wasn't going to be all about that. It was just that scene, but if it couldn't work with an African American man being the victim of violence in the one scene, I don't see how it would work with scenes in which the character entered battle with the alien against conspiratorial forces. The one thing I didn't do was put the character as the perpetrator of violence. I didn't even want to see what gpt would do with that knowing it was struggling with training bias. \n\nI'm open to suggestions though because I am really excited about the story and the opportunity the platform provides to issue sharp criticisms of the current system and practices. I also wanted to use it to showcase chatgpt's ability to meaningfully contribute to the story. It's a powerful tool but this experience was troubling.",
