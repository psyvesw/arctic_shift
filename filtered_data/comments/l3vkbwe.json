    "body": "Appreciate the input! An AI has settings and other things that can be controlled to prevent this homogenizing from happening if implemented for that purpose. Prior writing can also be added to the AI to learn your style and maybe even explain to you what your style is and even how it may be perceived by different demographics, etc... I actually am in the camp of having all formal communications that will have a broad audience reviewed by others or AI for accessibility purposes.\n\nOn the other hand you have neuro divergent students who can excel in some areas but fail in others and they have no need or desire to get better at writing etc... because they are only good at that one thing that they want to excel in. Should the use of AI in there writing Bar them from participating in something that writing is required but not mandatory for that person's actual desired skillset?",
