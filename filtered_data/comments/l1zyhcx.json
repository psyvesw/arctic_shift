    "body": "I just see it as progression and the reliance issues we're worrying about would be the same things that people worried about when changing from pencils to computers.\n\nSeeing AI as something that makes life easier isn't how I look at it. I just see it as we have a chance to learn a new skillset and it went push it we can achieve more. Ultimately we have a chance to integrate this technology and experience another bout of technological growth so rather than relying on it I'm going to learn to use it with as much effort and skill as I'd put into anything else and the power of AI is simply going to multiply that effort into something more. \n\nLike someone else said, it's a new skillset but not easiest. We now need to really learn to communicate with AI to get the best out of it (look how in-depth and well worded some prompts are)",
