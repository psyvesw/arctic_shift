    "body": "I really think the potential for AI is amazing and can benefit us in so many different ways. But people need to get a grip with some of these \"use cases\".\n\n>Language Learning\n\nNo \"nomad\" is using Duolingo to travel. If you're using Duolingo to learn a language it's because you, as a human being, want to be able to use that language. Google translate has been here for years now. If my sole purpose as a traveler was to get by in a foreign country I wouldn't be investing time into learning a language I'll be using for a couple weeks at most.\n\n>Bed Time Stories For Kids\n\nPlease, for the love of God, don't outsource reading/story time with your fucking kids to the machines.\n\n>Be My Friend\n\nI think this has the potential for good and a lot of potential for bad. The best use case here is to teach or foster socialization skills, not replace your need to socialize with actual people.\n\nThe rest I have no issue with. Using it to get the creative juices flowing is a great concept that many, including myself, have put into practice.\n\nWe just need to take a second and try to figure out the potential negative aspects this can have on people's social development. Especially for children. Machines are not human. The line separating the two should be abundantly clear.",
