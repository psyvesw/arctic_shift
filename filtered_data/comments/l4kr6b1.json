    "body": "All AIs today are still optimizers. LLMs are just meta optimizers that makes it even harder for us to explain how it got to the output it got to.\n\nInternally its still a huge neural network trying to optimize a loss function.\n\nWhen ml scientists speak that AIs are black boxes and that we dont understand them they dont mean that they dont know how AIs work. We absolutely know how AIs work. What we have trouble with is how for a given input the AI decided the particular output it decided to give us. What internal rules did it learn and what partitioning space did it use.\n\nAIs are STILL deterministic. But they are unpredictable because these systems are chaotic. Thats what scientists mean.",
