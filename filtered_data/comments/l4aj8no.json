    "body": "I got my upgrade to ChatGPT 4o. Just a few days ago with 3.5, I asked it to name some Chinese characters that look similar to each other. Some of the examples it gave were obviously wrong. Now with 4o I asked it again and apparently now it knows much better how the characters look.\n\nI think this is probably because to the old model, these things are just Unicode code points and nothing more. It knows a bit about their appearance, but this is only because it read stuff about that, it never saw it itself.\n\nHowever with the new version and the character recognition built into the model, it is able to reason much better about the shape of the characters. This is just my guess of course.\n\nHere is the conversation: [https://chatgpt.com/share/afe2f1b0-ce29-414e-b327-45ff7d88a617?oai-dm=1](https://chatgpt.com/share/afe2f1b0-ce29-414e-b327-45ff7d88a617?oai-dm=1)\n\nSorry about the re-upload, but I thought with the blue version tags the screenshot is less confusing.",
