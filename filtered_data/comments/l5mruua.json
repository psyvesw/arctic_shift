    "body": "Big thing you gotta understand about LLMs is that there is no 'training database'. Supposedly the training data for GPT-4 was a PETABYTE, aka 1000 terabytes or a *million* Gb. Despite that, the size of the actual model is probably around 200Gb. \n\nThink about other AIs you might have heard of, like the AIs that learned how to play Chess or Starcraft. They don't have some database attached of trillions of game histories with every move recorded where they \"check\" the data for the right move. They actually 'learn' in a way you could compare to biological intelligence. When you drive your car, you don't remember every single time you've driven or watched someone drive before. You just drive because all of that data in the past helped you create connections in your brain, neural pathways that streamline your mental processes. \n\nSo to answer your question, no, chat GPT isn't just finding some sample of the same question being asked. It 'understands' (as a manner of speaking) certain elements, and it can combine the connections it has.\n\nIt can tell you are asking for an explanation. It has seen plenty of examples of someone asking a question, and what good answers sound like. It knows what a meme is because it has seen plenty of content that discusses memes. It probably does have some exposure to the idea of \"explain this meme\". And it's going to have exposure to these ideas of like, the reasoning behind humor, subverting expectations, etc. It doesn't *understand*, it has no feeling or perception of *funny*, but part of its training included casual and formal conversations about the topics of memes or humor. \n\nSo you could create entirely new memes or jokes and it could explain them accurately. Just like an image AI could create a picture containing something it was never trained on, like a purple racoon with a giraffe neck. It has the ability to connect things and to view things as interconnected pieces.",
