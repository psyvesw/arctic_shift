    "body": "In elementary school, we were thought the tables of multiplication. From 1 times 1 to 10 times 10 and everything in between. We were thought it, drilled it so we knew all of the answers by heart. When someone asks me for 8*6, I'll instinctively answer \"48\" without having to perform any sort of arithmetic.\n\n56*12 is not a multiplication I encounter often. As such, I'll either need a second to calculate it in my head or grab a calculator for larger values. And in my opinion, I don't see how that's different from GPT whipping a quick calculation script to find the answer, it may not know it by heart, but it does know the operations it needs to perform to get the answer, just like I know how to perform the operations to find the answer.",
