    "body": "Just this morning, took a picture of my walk-in closet - there's a large open-cubby shelf along the back wall where the folded clothes go, with multiple piles of laundry on the floor (getting sorted before washing). I was curious what chatgpt would make out of the mess, snapped the pic and asked what outfit I should wear.\n\nIt said it looked like an explosion went off, but picked out a specific pair of shoes, pants and shirt that was folded on the shelf. I was cracking up and shocked at how well it done - I hadn't even noticed the shoes were in the photo.\n\nI took a selfie with the outfit and it commented on details like the color of the undershirt with my hoodie.\n\nPerhaps not as interesting as the education you're accumulating, but I'm consistently blown away by the potential of this technology, however its integrated. It's genuinely exciting and it's only the beginning.\n\nWould prefer it came with an Irish accent, though.",
