    "body": "Brother I am just winging it and feel like a kid tinkering with these cools. I guess the kids can sense my passion using these tools and that helps them using them effectively I just see the immense potential of these tools. Some ideas were from my students having an idea and us just going \"let's see what happens\". Everyone is complaining about our students getting worse and worse but nobody is adapting. These tools are so easy to use and can make for such an enriching environment. \n\nI am not one of those singularity people but I would be kidding myself lookging at the development of AI thinking that our education system will be able to continue teaching like literal 1950 farmers with books and pens. Seriously aside from using cameras to project the books or worksheets most teachers still use the same tools as schools have for the past 30 years. I talked to our parents about using ChatGPT in class. A lot of them had reservations thinking their kids would not be motivated to learn anymore seeing the machine do their work in seconds. I am figuring I'd rather show a 9 year old eager to learn how they can use them to better themselves rather than have a frustrated 14 year old use it the first time without supervision to cheat on homework. I am sure some of my studenst will take the stuff I have taught them to cheat later. But they probably would have done so otherwise. One mom contacted me asking for the prompt I use because her kid wanted to practice at home. The kid used to cry whenever I said we had to write stories (autistic, foreign student who struggles with German), now he wants to practice at home. happy teach",
