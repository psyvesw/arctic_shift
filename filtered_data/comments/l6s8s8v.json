    "body": "yes, but there's a huge difference in the impact it's having already on the real world vs. other passing tech trends. \n\nI get the strong feeling most people espousing these opinions that it's \"just a fad like NFTs\"  generally aren't in, or don't really talk to students in school or those in the corporate tech/law world or in teaching/medical/journalism.  Basically every single person in school I've talked to, no matter how good a student they are, can and has used chatGPT to get an enormous head start on writing essays/papers. \n\nAnd at work we literally have trainings on how to incorporate LLMs safely to increase our productivity. \"Safely\" because everyone's already using it, and \"to increase productivity\" because no matter how good you are, it can write/translate basic code/algorithms thousands of times faster than you can and there's no shortage of competition in the corporate tech world. I used it to write a DFS in 5 seconds that I knew in my head roughly how to write, but would've had to tediously write for probably hours.\n\nI really think these people that don't see these enormous benefits and use cases are working jobs like fast food/retail etc. (not that there's anything wrong with those, but just that it's skewing their perspective) and living in their basements with their heads up their asses, not talking to people in the rest of the real world actually using LLMs in both school and jobs.",
