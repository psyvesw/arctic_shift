    "body": "Oh absolutely. AI very well could hit a wall and reach a point where it barely improves. This was just assuming it keeps progressing at, or near the rate it is now. I agree with you, the monkey is still a monkey at its current state. I\u2019m just done personally ruling out achievements in AI. Every single time I\u2019ve said \u201cAI won\u2019t be able to do that for 5-10 years\u201d, it ends up doing exactly that within only 1-3. Maybe AI reaches a point of diminishing returns in terms of research. Or maybe it keeps growing exponentially and doesn\u2019t slow down.\n\nI guess only time will tell how it all plays out. For my sake, I\u2019m hoping it does hit a wall lol. I\u2019m not too fond of the idea of losing my job to AI.",
