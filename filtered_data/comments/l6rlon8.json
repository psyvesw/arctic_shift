    "body": "It can understand English sentences that alone was a massive breakthrough.  Maybe you aren\u2019t familiar with the history of ai . \n\nThe things ai is doing now were widely considered IMPOSSIBLE, 5 years before this\n\nAnd I can\u2019t stress that SIMPLY the ability to reply to any sentence in natural language is an unimaginably important achievement \n\nBut it goes WAY beyond that also understanding useful knowledge in code, medicine and other domains.  And able to complete text based tasks very reliably JUST through its nlp abilities . It has basically proven that there is nothing ultimately that ai won\u2019t be able to do with more development and research, \n\nIf you don\u2019t find that impressive it\u2019s understandable that you would think this is crazy but let me put it this way \n\nThe COMPUTERS ARE FUCKING TALKING BACK TO ME DUDE WERE YOU BORN yesterday?
