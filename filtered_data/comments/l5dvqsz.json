    "body": "I can't use it for anything, since it will only ever follow an instruction for ONE response, no matter what I do. I can't give detailed response parameters every time I type a question. Why do I need to add \"no bullet points, no numbered lists, and no multiple paragraph responses; conversational style only\" to EVERY. SINGLE. QUERY. and EVEN THEN it will only follow the instruction SOME of the time EVEN FOR THAT VERY NEXT RESPONSE, let alone the next one after that, which it will almost never happen. This stupid piece of shit is worse than my grandma with ADVANCED ALZHEIMERS. I have given up on AI until they figure out how to make it have a conversation in text as well as speech. If I wanted such responses that required extensive reading, I would just do the research myself.",
