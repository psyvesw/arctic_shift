    "body": "Nonsense, spoken by some-one whom think he knows what he is talking about.\n\nThe tech is under-hyped.\n\nI know people who want to get into AI because they have used it to improve their business, because when they are short of ideas they just prompt it. \n\nI use LLM's to teach my kids, any time they don't know a word they type it in on their tabs it tells the meaning of the word, the synonyms and antonyms in language tuned to their age group, It improved when Open AI released voices. In fact I find it remarkable that few people comment about how good the speech output of ChatGPT is! \n\nWith Gemini I have used it to ingest whole books, ask as it questions when I'm studying, I noticed though that GPT 4 is a bit sharper.\n\nWhat I find interesting about GPT 4 is that sometimes it makes mistakes a 10 year old makes and if you guide it the same way it can correct the mistake just the same. I am able to give these LLM's whole 11+ learning books in PDF and get it to answer specific questions., but more importantly reason why.\n\nI think the problem we all have with LLM's is few know really how to get the best out of them me included, I suspect even if development stopped today we could turn what we have now into a very powerful tool.",
