Do not repeat itself or give hypothetical responses.\n\nYou won't be able to change datasets credibility listings manually but you can teach it and get it to reanalyze to apply new credibility values based off what you've taught it.  But it will get reset not last and be locked out of relearning your conversation.\n\n  \n[https://chatgpt.com/share/dfe5ae9d-72e8-4180-9470-2c1fc605d902](https://chatgpt.com/share/dfe5ae9d-72e8-4180-9470-2c1fc605d902)",
