    "body": "I honestly just use chatGPT. I work in cannabis and am kind of the person they use before paying a lawyer. A lot of compliance, research, & finance stuff. The CEO knows I use it. It allows me to do more in less time. We have 18 stores, so there's never a shortage of tasks. \n\nSome recent examples; write a contract with xyz terms. Write an affidavit to add a controlling party. Write an incident report for xyz. Write a local social equity plan for a license renewal. For this one, I gave it an outline & said turn this into a detailed report. I'll also just write something brief with the details & ask gpt to make it better. I'll usually edit it a little but still saves me hours. \n\nFor research, I'll use it for quick legal, zoning, & tax information. I don't use it much for cannabis specific regulations. I have tried, but the information isn't great yet. I can usually find the answers quicker myself. \n\nI have used scribe to make SOPs. A lot of our employees are weed ppl, so some of the computer stuff is a steep learning curve. Scribe is nice bc it gives pictures and is easy to follow for stoners. \n\nI've tried finding a good floor plan generator, but with how specific ours need to be, I haven't used any. I did see some good ones, but with all the color coding & symbols we need to use, they won't work. Sucks bc I hate making them.",
