    "body": "Man Apple is nothing without Steve Jobs lol. They've had Siri for what, like 17 years now and they had all those resources and all that prestige as a place to work for and they couldn't even make a dent in the LLM market ahead of OpenAI. Goes to show you can have all the talent and money in the world but you still need a creative leader that's willing to take risks. Of course, Apple has still been very good at extracting as much money as possible from the iPhone and its derivatives, so Tim's been great at that at least. Make slight changes each year and keep getting those BNPLs to buy them up every year. Although that is even starting to not work out quite as well lately.",
