    "body": "> I said no one claims GPT-4 can do that in reference to knowing what letters are. And that it can't recognise what \"un\" is. \n\nThe moment someone claims you can have a conversation with gpt-4 like with any other human that of course extends to it answering like anyone with an IQ over 60. That includes  not answering the question about fruits with \"in\" as an ending with \"papaya\".\n\n> For your other use case there has never been any technology that can do anything remotely close to what you're describing, and you're still complaining that it's not 100% perfection. \n\nI am not complaining, otherwise I wouldn't pay for it. I am just saying your claim is wrong. Gpt-4 is still far from.perfect and flawed in many ways, yet people claim it can do all kinds of shit consistently which it cannot do consistently. Saying \"no one claims it can do that\" is just not right.",
