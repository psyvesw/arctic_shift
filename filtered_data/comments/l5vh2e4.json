    "body": "Welcome to the world of r/LocalLLaMA. There's not really one multimodal model out that's going to do everything you want, but if you use the right interface you can combine multiple different models together that work in tandem to provide the features you want.\n\nHowever, at the moment\u2014at least as far as my understanding goes\u2014ChatGPT4o's promised voice features are much, much faster than any other audio model available. You can use Whisper for your own speech recognition, and you can use AllTalk for text-to-speech. Both are quite accurate and surprisingly powerful, but these models just interface with the text-generation models; they don't actually allow a quick, seamless conversation like OpenAI are advertising with 4o. There can be significant delay from when the text-generation model finishes its output and when AllTalk's model starts speaking. Without a 4090, it's not even close to a conversational speed.\n\nThat said, Whisper's speech recognition and voice dictation is good and quick. If you're willing to read the AI's text output, then you can at least talk to the AI without needing to type.\n\nAs for searching the web and generating images, you'll need to use the correct user interface, something that can provide both. Most LLaMA-3 models are capable of web search, as far as I'm aware, but you'll need to make sure it's loaded into software that can facilitate that functionality. For image generation, you'll need a ComfyUI backend, integrated into your main UI through the API. If you're an advanced PC user, this isn't hard. It's just a lot to learn all at once.",
