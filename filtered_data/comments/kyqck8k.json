ChatGPT only will calculate calories from basic products while apps allow you to scan either product by barcode, count macroelements and adjust the weight you should aim at.\n\nTranscribing from paper isn't really revolutionary since it was already available before chatgpt was announced. What the picture shows is that chatgpt can perform basic OCR and search by it.",
