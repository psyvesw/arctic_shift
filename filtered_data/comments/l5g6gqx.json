    "body": "What you are implying is that ChatGPT is some sort of all knowing god that must be trusted and with whom you can have an educated conversation. It is not and I will explain you why (I use it a lot) :\n1. It has a lot of inaccuracies and will make mistakes\n2. It works almost as a Web browser but it will give you a reason behind his response, no just the article.\n3. Simple math is a problem, you cannot use it for calculation (90% of the time will give you the wrong answer)\n4. For coding/programming is as bas as for math. It will do simple stuff but when you start having long programs with a lot of variables will just respond weird stuff. You will spend all your day telling him what's wrong (because you see it) just for him to do the same.\n\nSo, I think your approach is wrong because you should use it for things you already know but don't fully remember (the rules on how to do a limit, or how to do an integral, or how to do something in Photoshop, etc).\n\nFrom my experience (I've been paying it for more than one year) it has the attention of a 3 years old. Will start ok but then will start repeating things, getting out of context, saying weird stuff, directly changing subject, etc. That's why some teachers will know if you are using GPT to do your homework because it repeats himself each 30 words.\n\nGpt should give you another perspective on how the thing you are asking him should be done (implying you already know how to do it) and nothing else. Then you use this information to improve whatever you have already made. That's why IT, Programming, Web Developing still exist and have not been replaced by IA even if nowadays we have close to 400.",
