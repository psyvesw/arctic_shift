    "body": "I couldn't help but read into the differences between the two presentations while watching the Google event. Humble research group bringing high science to the masses vs the giant corporation with a production budget. I mean, sure, your gut might watch them fake interview a celebrity and ask, \"What if they redirected this energy into their AI product?\" But then you realize, yeah of course they did. No shit. Gemini is being worked into a gigantic, megalithic ecosystem that literally directly affects like half the human population. What they've done in the time they've done it is remarkable. \n\nI consciously decide to use ChatGPT over Gemini a few times a day. But I unconsciously use Gemini all the time and barely notice it. I forgot I was using the Generative Search Experience for months and months until they announced everyone was getting it. It very much fixes googling and is one of those \"it just works\" things about technology that allows you to ignore the millions of dollars it took to make happen.\n\nMark this: ChatGPT when the output is the product. Gemini to make the information more accessible.",
