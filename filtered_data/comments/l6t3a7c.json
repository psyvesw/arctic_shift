    "body": "So I actually thought about it a little and thought about two potential ideas.  Literally spend like 3 hours making a nice course on how to get rich by ai (using ai to create the course).  Use AI to figure out how to market it.  Use AI to to figure out how to charge and stuff.  So that's an option.... \n\nI think using ai to create a weight loss program might actually have some traction.  \n\nOr using ai for educational purposes such as how to get into a niche hobby that has a high learning curve.  Use that information to create like a webpage or Facebook group that can eventually get ad revenue.  Maybe there's a way AI could automatically create new posts every hour on the hour to build up popularity... Who knows.... \n\n\nThere are probably really scummy ways to make money with it too with the main idea of scamming desperate people that your information can help them overcome X.  But maybe it could also actually be helpful like in the hobby idea... \n\nCould use it to write a course on random niche business topics that you're qualified to speak on.  For example if I was a dog trainer already, I could use it to create a full day seminar on dog training and go do some sort of contracting work with other companies who do dog training.  (Dog training could be literally any other job.... Or maybe there's a hot button issue in dog training that you could sell yourself with.  I.e. how to train dogs with history of trauma or abuse).",
