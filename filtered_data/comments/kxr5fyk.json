    "body": "I'm a hobby writer, I think we will see things like \"make star wars but with animals and Luke is a racoon and Vader a giant pig\" type of material. \n\nBut as (screen)writer we could have a very powerful tool in our hands. Style checking, previz, blocking help, ai voices vocalizing your script in a real scene can help *a lot* to refine your work. Professional writers can afford to invite a couple of quality actor friends for a couch read, most can't.\n\nManga artists already train ais to help them create their backgrounds that can save them weeks of work, in an industry that is know for harsh exploitation. We won't stop the wave but a regular tool in the hands of maestros can even give you more advantages then before. Writers just needed a piece of paper and a pen. In 20 years, if you don't use that tech you are one of the 1% the others have to.",
