    "body": "yea thats a nice thoughtful thing to do, I mean dont get me wrong I love the idea I love NNs they are absolutely amazing and incredible for many research applications, many breakthroughs that we've been able to do have been because of companies working on systems like this and sharing their methods, but the blatant stealing of hundreds of peoples music that they spent time and emotion working on so that it can be churned through a NN and used to make songs about burgers doesn't sit right with me... like a 'blues afrobeat' song about 'resistance' generated by ai that's powered by stealing years worth of musical culture (by definition this is cultural appropriation, but a lot of people don't really care so ill just leave it at that) , just doesn't sit right with me",
