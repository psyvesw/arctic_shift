    "body": "I know how you feel, but actually you\u2019re not stupid, you just didn\u2019t pay enough attention in math class. The math that goes into AI is actually pretty simple. Sure, state of the art AIs like deep reinforcement learning and LLMs and stuff might be a little more complex to understand mathematically, but when it comes down do it, it\u2019s just basic calculus and simple linear algebra. It can be daunting to start, but I\u2019d say even if you\u2019re just average intelligence, you can definitely learn the basics pretty easily, you just have to have some sisu, a little bravery and not get scared by complex looking maths, because under the surface, it\u2019s actually pretty straightforward. 3B1B has a great series on the essence of linear algebra and calculus and another one on neural networks that simplifies everything down, I highly recommend you check that out, I\u2019m currently teaching one of my friends who is interested to learn about LLMs but actually only did humanitarian subjects in his A-levels (SAT equivalent in UK). He seems to respond really well to the 3B1B videos. Good luck friend, I hope you stick with it, because it really is a world of wonder.",
