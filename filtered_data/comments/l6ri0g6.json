    "body": "Ok, I posted this elsewhere. I can\u2019t code in anything other than Basic.\n\nI\u2019ve just spent a week developing a medical education app in Python. 5000 lines - 1300 in the core program and the rest in a growing data .json that AI also puts together.\n\nI don\u2019t understand the syntax or language of Python but after 7 days of dev work I, someone who knows no modern computer language, have a program that presents cases, allows GPT-4o AI review of answers, facilitates AI diagnoses of clinical images via Vision, allows speech input via Whisper, and outputs responses via Azure speech.\n\nIt\u2019s game changing stuff. I used it on day 2 of development at work and now on day 7 it\u2019s far better than it was then.\n\nI have a million words of source data to input, and AI is going to do the grunt work of making that into a .json complete with custom formatting tags.\n\nSo as a non-developer, an idea I had last weekend is now a mature product that will be used to train doctors tomorrow morning. \n\nPre-LLM, it would have taken me years to develop the skills to do that.",
