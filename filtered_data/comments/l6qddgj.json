    "body": "I agree completely. That\u2019s going to be the consequence of any kind of gan. And I think it\u2019ll take a major mathematical breakthrough in the form of a new architectural paradigm beyond what llm\u2019s and neural nets offer, and probably it will come from quantum. But when (not if) that happens, it will quite literally be the floodgates that open; all of the quirks and faults will disappear (theoretically) pretty quickly (although I expect new ones to be introduced, albeit at a much less noticeable scale).\n\nI think of it like shuffling a deck of cards: when a human shuffles a deck of cards vs. when a rng shuffles a deck of cards, the difference in results is crazy. Literally completely different, even though they should both (theoretically) be the same result over a million shuffles. As it turns out, people don\u2019t really shuffle cards randomly (no surprise).\n\nIt\u2019ll be the same in time with agi, so much so that we won\u2019t even understand how different the world will be compared to how we know it today. The difference in output will be so drastically different that we\u2019ll probably learn as much or more about our own limitations as we will about what ml can do.",
