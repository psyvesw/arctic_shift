    "body": "I understand your point, but even when searching on Google, we have to double check because not all websites provide accurate information. I remember when I was researching to learn new English words, some sites offered different definitions and I had to search and search, and search again to finally find and understand what I really needed. We can't rely on a single source, even when it comes to websites written by real people...\n\nThe list it generated for you, if there are words you're familiar with, you can gather them and seek out the ones ChatGPT couldn't precisely handle. It's frustrating when it doesn't provide the right answers every time, but it's understandable... I mean, it's a powerful tool, and it's only been around since 2022, right? That's not a long time at all, but it's already much more advanced than previous AIs like Google Assistant or Alexa, even though errors are inevitable. That's why I believe we and everyone else should be cautious about trusting ChatGPT blindly to avoid any misinformation it might generate, unfortunately... I think that since the beginning, people have overestimated chatGPT's capacity to create something precisely and perfectly for us on the first try, and when it fails, we get frustrated. Well, it sucks, I know. :|",
