    "body": "I\u2019ve tried having gpt grade work for me before. I try again at each major update. It doesn\u2019t work very well no matter how I prompt it. The usual issue is that it\u2019s so lenient and defaults to giving more points than justified. The next issue is that blank answers confuse it and causes it to hallucinate enough to make it unreliable. Then, it\u2019s notoriously bad at tallying up the points. In the end, I\u2019d spend just as much time prompting and revising its work and could have just graded it myself.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I teach AP physics, so maybe the content is just too difficult, but I don\u2019t see it being that much better in other subject areas. The reasoning required for grading is just not something current LLMs are capable of. I\u2019ll try again with gpt 5. Opus is also not good at the task.",
