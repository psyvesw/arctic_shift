    "body": "In my experience, it's best with helping out for writing. I often am writing something and I simply can't find a good word or phrase for what I'm trying to say. I can just plug it into ChatGPT and it'll give me a suggestion that's usually pretty good. This can also help when drafting formal emails.\n\nOf course, dictionaries and thesauruses exist. But it really does streamline the process since it can actually understand context. \n\nNow, it is absolute *dogshit* at doing the writing itself. You 100% need to put in the work, and then it can sometimes help you out with polishing up the final product. **NEVER** use it to fully write something by itself. The fact that some students are using ChatGPT to write entire assignments utterly terrifies me.\n\nLikewise, be very skeptical of people telling you to use it as a search engine. I have definitely asked it for certain things that I simply could not find on Google for whatever reason. But I always, always, *always* double check with a traditional search engine. That might seem counterintuitive, but there are certain queries that Google is just shit at handling for whatever reason.\n\n(Worth noting that GPT-4o actually does search the internet for answers, but it'll take some more testing to see how accurate it is.)",
