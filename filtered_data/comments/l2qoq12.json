    "body": "I think vague extrapolation like he's doing is exactly what these companies want people doing. People have their head so stuck in the clouds right now thinking of the best and worst implications of AI that they forget AI is a product and the hottest selling one on the market. OF COURSE these companies are going to market it as the coming of tech Jesus. They have every reason to hype the shit out of it because the profit incentive is insane. People need to look at the shit these CEOs and \"researchers\" are saying as if Todd Howard or Sean Murray or Stefan Molyneux are saying them. \n\nNot to say we haven't made some awesome developments in AI over the past few years but I can't help but roll my eyes in the back of my fucking head when people say \"it's EVOLVING\".",
