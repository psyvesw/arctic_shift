    "body": "Right! I thought so too! \n\nIt\u2019s just sooo unpredictable how improving property x of those networks will impact result y. In the end you do see improvements, but they are very uneven across the board.\n\nThose models are better than 90% of people in the LSAT (or Bar exam, forgot) but then absolutely fail to collect all the conclusions we have drawn so far in a relatively short conversation? Even if it was just like 10 bullet points?\n\nThey behave like one of those savants that have perfect recall / encyclopedic knowledge but then can\u2019t manage to do simple things. It\u2019s\u2026 strange. \ud83e\udd14\n\nI just had a conversation with it about my absolute core field of expertise. And I would be like a professor in an oral in a specialized graduate level course and it would be the student. And the result is that it felt like a student was sitting in front of me that just memorized books but doesn\u2019t actually understand what he / she is saying. \n\nI know this is pretty unfair, grilling the LLM on some tiny expert field. But there you see how it just doesn\u2019t realize what it doesn\u2019t understand. It was absolutely cringe. But if you aren\u2019t an expert you would never see that! It all seems to superficially match with books and so on.",
