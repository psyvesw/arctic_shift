Here are 10 Chuck Norris jokes for you:\\n\\n1. Chuck Norris doesn't do push-ups, he pushes the Earth down.\\n2. When Chuck Norris plays hide and seek, he never hides. He just stands still and expects the other players to find him.\\n3. Chuck Norris can divide by zero. And that's why math is afraid of him.\\n4. Chuck Norris doesn't need a GPS to find his way. He just stares at the map until it submits to his will.\\n5. Chuck Norris doesn't have a favorite food. His food just hasn't met his standards yet.\\n6. Chuck Norris once won a game of Monopoly by buying all the properties and then just giving them away to his opponents.\\n7. Chuck Norris can solve a rubix cube in under 30 seconds, but only if he's wearing his lucky socks.\\n8. Chuck Norris doesn't wear a watch because time is too slow for him. He just knows what time it is by how fast his beard grows.\\n9. Chuck Norris once broke the internet. With his beard.\\n10. When Chuck Norris does a roundhouse kick, he creates a small black hole that sucks everything in a 5-mile radius into oblivion. That's why no one ever sees him land. They're all too busy getting sucked into the void.\"},\"done\":true,\"total_duration\":31459428252,\"load_duration\":2518989121,\"prompt_eval_count\":149,\"prompt_eval_duration\":609791000,\"eval_count\":336,\"eval_duration\":28328422000}",
