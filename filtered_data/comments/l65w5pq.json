    "body": "I'm also working on a project with this goal.\n\nHumans have motivations, needs, things they want, things they care about, interests, beliefs, hobbies, talking styles picked up from the regions they've spent time in, culture, mannerisms, personalities. GPT4o is great at following most of the rules here. Less so with older models from my experience.\n\nThe greatest difficulty I encounter is with consistency. All of those things I've pointed out amount to rules for the AI to follow. But if you're aware of the needle in the haystack test, it sometimes ignores rules and sometimes those ignored rules are vital from a storytelling perspective. The models continue to improve and this becomes less a problem over time, but it's still there right now.\n\nThe GPT4o demo seemed promising, but last I checked it still isn't fully available in the API. I really want accents. Accents immediately tell you where a person spent a large part of their childhood, as well as their exposure to formal education and people outside their culture. I'm sure I've missed some things, but those were the ones off the top of my head.",
