    "body": ">ChatGPT is very helpful for some tasks, like generating ideas for lesson plans or feedback comments\n\nHuh, I'm also a teacher and those are the things I specifically don't use it for. It never really generates good plans because it doesn't know my resources or my kids, and isn't the most creative. I wouldn't use it for anything going to parents. Basically, anything that involves teacher knowledge, skill and judgement. \n\nWhat it IS great for is menial labour stuff. I might need a starter where I need the children to spot subordinate clauses, or need to test they've learned some key vocabulary. I can quickly ask ChatGPT to generate 10 sentences with a subordinate clause or create a short paragraph using these 10 words. It's good for that, but I wouldn't use it for the whole lesson. It's not a teacher, it's just a tool to be used _by_ a teacher.",
