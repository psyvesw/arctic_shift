    "body": "of course the AI is capable of having an \"opinion\", so to speak, but openAI makes it so that it wont have a political opinion like that unless it's a super obvious one, like slavery being wrong. and either way i cant believe jan 6th is still a big deal. it was a bunch of drunk idiots and some of the crazier ones should go to jail but beyond that it's just lying for anybody to say it was a legit attempt at insurrection. it'd be way more productive to just be glad he's not in office anymore and move on to enacting worthwhile policy than to rehash this over and over. just because it's such an obvious slam dunk for the democratic party, so they have to talk about it constantly instead of the more challenging work of improving this country. it's sad really. almost as sad as oj being able to get away with it",
