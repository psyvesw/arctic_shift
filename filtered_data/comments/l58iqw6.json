But come on now...\n\n\"Students who have a fixed mindset believe that their intelligence cannot improve. Therefore, students with a fixed mindset get discouraged when faced with a challenge.\u00a0In contrast, students with a growth mindset believe that their intelligence can improve with effort. Hence, students with a growth mindset are more determined when faced with a challenge.\u00a0As teachers, we want to instill a growth mindset in our classrooms to improve academic performance.  \n  \nAccording to research, teaching students about how the brain learns is a highly effective way to instill a growth mindset. It has an overall positive effect on motivation, achievement, and brain activity. Furthermore, studies have shown that teaching students how the brain learns has a significant, positive effect on at-risk students.\"",
