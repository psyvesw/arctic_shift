Until AI understands and can emulate emotion that is undetectably similar to that of a human, all of this is going to be ai generated trash. It's delusional to think that writing some text will replicate the work and attention to detail generated by the hundreds of people that it takes to make a movie.\n\nI know everyone thinks they have a new way to fake it 'till you make it, but it ain't happening. Just having an idea isn't enough, you need to know how to tell a story on screen.\n\nStop trying to be fucking lazy, skipping steps and the work, and use AI to learn the art and craft of filmmaking.",
