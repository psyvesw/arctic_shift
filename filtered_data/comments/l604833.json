    "body": "I think the point that the students who did this research were trying to make is precisely what you say. Hence why they used 3.5. They are trying to produce a study that can be used to show uneducated users why blind trust in ChatGPT is a problem. I don't understand why so many people in this thread are up in arms abut it. You should read the conclusion of the article. \n\nHere's the relevant excerpt: \"Additionally,  our linguistic analysis results show that ChatGPT answers are very formal, and rarely portray negative sentiments. Although our user study shows higher user preference and quality rating for human answers, users make occasional\nmistakes by preferring incorrect ChatGPT answers based on ChatGPT's articulated language styles, as well as seemingly correct logic that is presented with positive assertions. Since ChatGPT produces a large number of incorrect answers, our results emphasize caution and awareness regarding the usage of ChatGPT in programming tasks.\"\n\nThe _relevant_ conclusion to the study isn't that answers are wrong. They just needed that number as a basis to show why user preferences for \"formal\" and \"positive\" answers are a problem in relation to ChatGPT use.",
