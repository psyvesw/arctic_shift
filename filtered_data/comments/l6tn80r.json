It increases the supply of art, which in turn reduces the value of art...Reduces the ability to get paid for making art.  But the effect is distributed very unevenly:  \n\nIt's having a huge effect in the world of $50-$200 art.  It's going to become a big deal (or, bigger deal) in the movie CGI business.  It'll churn out mundane commercial art.  On the other hand, few if any people who were spending thousands or tens of thousands of dollars on a painting are replacing that with an AI print.  It's hard to argue that there will be less interest in great or innovative human-made art because of AI.  In other words, it's making the mass media consumed by poor to average people.  And it is making it easier to produce.\n\n\nBefore AI OP could make a trade wherein they made some art for another person and that person did some \"laundry\" for OP.  With AI, the person doing laundry no longer wants that trade and OP has to do their own laundry while the other person doesn't have to do as much laundry to get the same amount of art.  This is a class thing and OP is not on the right side of it.\n(\"Laundry\" being a stand in for any menial job that nobody really wants to do but many people want the fruits of)",
