    "body": "This is the most on-point comment I've read about cGPT.\n\nI often recommend it for language learning (it's a language model afteral) and am constantly flamed by 99% of the replies banging on about how many mistakes it makes, and giving me examples of incorrect (or vague) replies to guestions where they gave it no context.\n\nFor me, it is far better than having a language tutor sat next to me 24/7, because over the course of a conversation (or you can just put the instructions in the settings) it learns my way of thinking, and responds accordingly.\n\nI NEVER use it as my only source of information, or even as my primary source of information.\n\nI will take a concept I've learned/studies elsewhere, and either explain my interpretation of it (in my own words), or ask cGPT to explain it to me, so I can fact check both my understanding and cGPT's, as well approach that concept from different angles and perspectives, and then ask about other concepts which might be related etc.\n\nIt's so useful for me to be able to analyze things from different viewpoints, as I end up with a way deeper understanding on the concept than if I'd just re-read the same textbook lesson 10 times.\n\nMost people who say that it's useless as a learning tool don't understand how to work within it's limitations, or how to give it enough context within their prompts in order to give it a better chance of success. \n\nI genuinely don't understand how people can hate on it so much. Unless it's only because they don't understand it?",
