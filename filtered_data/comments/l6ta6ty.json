    "body": "If it can do it, then it is not \"hard work\" and probably an algorithm or a problem it has been trained a thousand times on. Just keep using it whenever you can.\n\nIf you'r worried about \"relying on it too much\" then you're probably a junior develepor and don't have an actual product to worry more about. In that case, I'd suggest of course not. You have to learn and challenge yourself with more complex problems if you're still in that learning stage.\n\nAI won't help you for when you face a very specific problem and the solution it'd give, while it might work, it wouldn't be the best or the most efficient. I faced too many of these more than I care to count and I'm a senior developer. I always use AI to refactor, brainstorm, and generally accelerate my work. But like someone here said before, it is a hit or miss for more complex problems.\n\nI actually love it when it gives me something I haven't thought of, but the sad thing is, more than 90% of the problems I face, although seemingly simple, require some out of the box solutions, the kind of solutions you wouldn't even find on StackOveflow. That's when you'd appreciate your own skill more.",
