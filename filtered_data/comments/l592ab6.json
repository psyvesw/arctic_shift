    "body": "Fine, here's the revised version:\n\nI dare say that he is against AI generated art.\n\nHe defended, several times, that animation should be about portraying real people. Several of his characters are based on real people that he met.\n\nThere\u2019s the infamous rant that he made about the anime industry a decade ago. He claimed that the industry was full of people that could not stand other people, that they were otakus, closed in their own world.\n\nSo imagine coming up to this guy and trying to sell him an AI. If he rants about people that do not understand other people, imagine the fuse that would pop out of him when you explained to him that these algorithms use advanced neural networks and machine learning techniques to generate new images and videos from scratch, based on learned patterns and features from large datasets. These processes include adversarial training, noise diffusion, and deep learning techniques that go beyond simple mixing and matching of existing images. For instance, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates images from random noise, while the discriminator evaluates these images to determine if they are real or generated. Through this adversarial process, the generator improves its ability to create realistic images. Diffusion models work by adding noise to an image and then learning to reverse this process to generate new images. This involves a forward diffusion process (adding noise) and a reverse diffusion process (removing noise) to create high-quality images from random noise. AI image generators often use neural networks trained on large datasets of images and text. These networks learn patterns and features from the data, enabling them to generate new images based on textual descriptions. Models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion use this approach to create images that match the input text prompts. AI video generators use similar principles but are more complex due to the temporal dimension. They often employ GANs and other neural network architectures to generate coherent video sequences from text prompts or other inputs. This involves understanding motion patterns and ensuring temporal consistency across frames. These processes are far more sophisticated than merely mixing and matching existing images.",
