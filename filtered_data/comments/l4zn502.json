    "body": "I would put your anger to the billion dollar goofy LLM that is careless and doing the Elon model of big unicorn start up method\u2026 this carelessness is a small symptom of the larger issue that exists at this org..they went out of their way to make the thing like someone and not do the full checks or balances. Thats a trend with these folks. \n\nI have a lot of family in the LLM space as PHD having researchers and developers. A close friend of mine is a LLM dev. I just listen to what they have to say about it and definitely not smart enough or in tune enough with it to have a strong opinion on any of this. But Everyone in that space is waiting on OpenAi to trip and fall if/when they fuck up badly enough.  Anthropic is doing the regulation and study and care correctly\u2026 maybe OpenAI gets lucky. Luckily there\u2019s some brilliant folks at Anthropic that are leading the charge and releasing some amazing papers around LLM care and ethics.",
