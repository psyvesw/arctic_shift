    "body": "I've been worrying about my aging parents lately. They're getting to where they can't remember what the doctor said, or they don't understand. I'm not able to go with them. \n\nBut with lab results and doctors notes sometimes being available online, as long as I can log in and run things through ChatGPT to get an explanation that we can all understand, it helps a lot to reduce the anxiety or fear that we have when you have to wait days or weeks for a followup with the doctor to have them simply explain things to you. Especially when tests come back and are \"normal\".\n\nOf course, things might go the other way some day, and I'll copy and paste and get the terrible news.\n\n\"Here is what the report suggests: If you have money, go spend it on the most expensive bottle of bourbon and be sure get out to that fancy new restaurant. Do one thing every day from your bucket list. You've only got about 30 days left.\"",
