    "body": "LLMs, cannot reason in the same way humans do. Instead, they generate responses based on patterns identified during extensive data training. If these models could think and reason like humans, they wouldn\u2019t require as much data; they could simply learn from experience and apply knowledge flexibly across different contexts. Human reasoning allows us to learn adaptively and make informed guesses, a capability that LLMs lack. LLMs operate by predicting the next word in a sequence based on probabilities, not by understanding or reasoning about the content.\n\nAGI is when we get to  a level of intelligence where machines can reason, understand, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, akin to human cognitive abilities. AGI would enable truly human like intelligence that can independently learn and adapt in diverse situations.\n\nThe Black Box Problem is an example of this where, at risk of oversimplification, an AI will make decisions without being able to explain the reasoning behind it. Whereas a system that truly thinks and reasons would make a decisions and explain why it made that decision. Rn to my knowledge LLMs can only \u201cthink\u201d to the point of \u201cthe words \u2018is hot\u2019 had a 99.99% confidence score in relation to the prior words\u201d",
