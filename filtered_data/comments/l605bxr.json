    "body": "See, that is a valid point that I have myself brought up in another comment of mine, because I think it has merit. And it's tangible, unlike your hypothetical other people who might disagree somewhere out there, probably.\n\nOf course, there's *also* the fact that if the market for CSAM gets flooded with AI images indistinguishable from reality that basically kills demand for the real stuff - especially since even if someone passes it off as \"real\" there would be no way to know. Which in turn would actually save a ton of kids from being exploited.\n\nBut let's not dwell on that, for now I'm just impressed and proud that you actually managed to make something resembling a coherent point instead of hitting me with \"w-well other people somewhere disagree with you!!!\"",
