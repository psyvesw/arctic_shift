    "body": "They can't. Here's why.\n\nLarge-language models are using human-written text to train on. So the words that are coming together are a synthesis of what's been written by humans. These things aren't truly creative (I've yet to see one coin a word and start using it, for instance).\n\nWhat people are noticing are words that *they* don't use showing up, which is why OP's comment about \"delve into\" and such come up. Heck, I grew up in Chicago; I didn't encounter \"bless your heart\" until I was an adult. Does that mean any text using \"bless your heart\" is AI generated? Of course not.\n\nTo put it another way: An argument from ignorance is no argument. Just because someone says, \"I don't use this phrase, so anything that does must be AI\" doesn't mean they are correct.",
