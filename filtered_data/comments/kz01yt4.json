    "body": "Aside from accidentally implying that producers aren't artists (they are, often moreso than the people that leverage their skills), I worded my statement very carefully.\n\nIt doesn't matter how little producing talent it requires to create a certain thing - it takes relatively little skill to create a  generic, copy paste, \"type\" beat. But if I'm an amateur rapper, I'm likely to go view this giant collection of free beats to use on YouTube, even if it took little skill to create or if there was little care put into it, because that is far more skill than I am willing to learn in that particular moment.\n\nIf AI is going to be able to make generic beats (it will do much better than generic very rapidly), then why would I deal with the hassle of finding a beat that fits what I want to do, having to potentially pay for the beat, licensing, crediting, and all around hassle that comes when handling somebody else's creative work when I could just go to an AI and say \"make me a Kendrick style beat at 150 bpm\"? \n\nNow, producers will obviously still exist, but the people who use producers will realize at some point that they don't *need* to, and I predict that most amateur artists will forego the hassle in favor of AI.",
