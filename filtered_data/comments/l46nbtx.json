    "body": "Most software tools we've used so far will do some part of that, but not all. Google will search, but often comes up with junk. AI will search and perhaps provide more useful stuff with the site links. Travel map help can show you the roads and suggest the way that was best last week, but with AI we might be able to link chatter on social sites to learn that last important part, so the final advice is better.\n\nLinking together various things the way we try to do with pre-AI could be a big leap. For example, when we can ask AI to create a spreadsheet with tracking of wealther or stock prices or something, using another tool specifically for that (spreadsheet software, weath or stock price news sources, etc.), that would be like combining screws with screwdrivers and bolts with wrenches. It multiplies the power.\n\nRight now they're just getting the AI right for language, conversation, interaction with the Internet, and little else (math and computer coding come to mind). Add one more jump to using special software tools and it will have a huge effect. Right now you can ask it to give code for a software task, but it stops there. When you can ask it to go ahead and compile and test run that code, that will involve other special tools (compiler, interpreter, etc.) and that will be huge.",
