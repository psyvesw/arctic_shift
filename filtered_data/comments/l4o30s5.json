    "body": "Access to the model tbh.\n\nOf course the newer omni chat features to my knowledge are coming primarily to plus users but outside of that, think about it.\n\nThey\u2019re adding millions of people to the new model. That\u2019s a lot of server traffic. Free users get bumped down to 3.5 when there\u2019s high traffic. \n\nOutside of high traffic it\u2019s what? 16 messages? So as they throttle that number people will drop to 3.5 a lot more often. This is an assumption until it fully rolls out and we can confirm but due to traffic I was constantly hitting GPT-4 caps in the earlier days, I can only imagine what the server load on this roll out will be and the convenience of generally sticking on 4o instead of 60% of the time 3.5 is likely worth it imo. I believe from a vid I saw (could be wrong) plus users get numbed down to 4 in high traffic times before they get dropped to 3.5\n\nIf that last part is correct that\u2019s a huge advantage knowing you can consistently have a better model even when things get busy.",
