    "body": "It\u2019s mostly because hands are the small part of human body, they\u2019re very variable and in real life hands aren\u2019t usually the focus of the pic, so these AIs don\u2019t get \u201ctrained\u201d to focus as much on hands as they do, for example, on faces. The same issue happens with human teeth, ears etc. \n\nThis takes me to the next point- since our hands are very detailed, complex in structure and we as humans have access to three-dimensional world, we know how these visual discrepancies (such as different hand poses) from various angles work. AI doesn\u2019t know anything about our world and it struggles to conceptualize geometry of a hand because doesn\u2019t understand 3D objects or function of a hand the way we do (nor it understands text when it appears in images). \n\nAs for art, drawing hands has always been difficult due to the complex shape, many bones, tendons and muscles they have, as well as their proportion to the body. They\u2019re tricky to break down into 3D shapes on a paper and for that reason many artists in the past struggled with drawing hands.  Even today, hands are seen as one of the hardest things to draw/paint.",
