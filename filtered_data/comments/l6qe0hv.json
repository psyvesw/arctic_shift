    "body": "It's a great teacher up to high school. But if you try to work with it as an undergrad, you can see the \"inteligence\" has limits. I'm a grad student now and I try really hard to use it as an effective tool, but the fact is, it's not there yet and has a long way to go. That's why I'm not that excited YET. I used to be at first, but seeing how many mistakes it makes, it's just much more work that it seems, and it's not time-effective compared to own research.\n\nBut it seems like Harpa AI page context on scientific papers might be the tool that I needed the most and that makes me happy.",
