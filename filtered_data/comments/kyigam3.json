    "body": "The roles of a government are manyfold, but one important one is enforcing standards.\n\nI am somebody who likes standards. ISO standards like A4 and the time standard ISO 8601 solve many problems. Names like Honey and Beer are protected and have precise definitions of what they are. You can't make some sugary goo and call it Honey, you will be heavily fined.\n\nAnd this is good, because people get exactly what they expect when they put their paper into a printer, or when they deal with dates, or when they buy honey. It solves so many problems, that some people don't understand how miserable life would be without them.\n\nNow with AI. I find it appalling that AI is being tempered with. The most horrific is Google's digusting Gemini that was made woke. In my opinion there should be a standard of what these language models are, how they are trained and that one should not temper with them and if one does, like stretching honey with sugar, then there should be a way for consumers to know that. Like you are no longer are allowed to call it honey, in the case of AI you should be forced to put a mandatory label saying that \"THIS MODEL HAS BEEN TEMPRED WITH AND GIVES IMPRECISE INFORMATION ABOUT POLITICAL ENTITIES, HISTORY AND CULTURE\".\n\nBut don't expect modern politicians to fix that, the dumas, parlaments, bundestags and congresses are filled with low IQed nobodies and all they do is shill for their donors.",
