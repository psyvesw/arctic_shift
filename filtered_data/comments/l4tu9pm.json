    "body": "I'm not sure what you think you know about me, but I can assure you that you are incorrect. I'm speaking in my role working with and supporting faculty whose jobs have been made tremendously more complex by the rapid emergence of a technology that for the first time in the history of higher education can't effectively be slow rolled. Literally nothing has ever emerged with the speed and impact that Gen AI has and at an inflection point where institutional mechanisms can't be deployed to slow it down enough to get a handle on it.\n\nPersonally though, my job isn't going anywhere in 2 years because my position is not in any way directly threatened by Gen AI. If anything I'm actually made more essential, and I was already essential. It will take the kind of technology that will literally put almost everyone out of a job for it to be a threat to my position.\n\nIf you think that's coming in 2 years, then my personal job security is honestly the least of my worries because we'll collectively have a much more difficult problem on our hands.",
