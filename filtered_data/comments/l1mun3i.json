    "body": "I\u2019m in the same boat with you, OP. I have my appeal meeting tomorrow. I am bringing a stack full of other AI detection services that have deemed my exact same writing from 0%-70% AI, all fluctuating vastly. TurnItIn said \u201c100%\u201d. Since when in society are we extrapolating in absolutes? Nothing is ever 100%. Ever. Also, I\u2019m geared with statements from major, state-flagship universities like Duke, Vanderbilt, Northwestern, MIT, etc. who absolutely do NOT use this approach when trying to determine whether a students work is authentic. They\u2019ve have either abandoned or have not ever implemented it within their institutions. \n\nI attend a small college and they live and die by this detector. Needless to say, I can not wait to \u201ccook\u201d, as the cool kids are saying. Best of luck and stay well, OP. \ud83e\udee1",
