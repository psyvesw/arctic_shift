    "body": "Online AI checkers are notoriously inaccurate. Something that is generally well written is often flagged as AI. You can't really rely on those tools for determining the authenticity of someone's work.\n\nBut yes, ChatGPT's default tone, verbiage, and organizational flow is really easy to spot when little is done to conceal its source. I've been in group projects (graduate level) where people in my group had obviously ChatGPT-generated content as their \"contribution\". I had to call them out for it so our project didn't look like ass.\n\nI find ChatGPT still has difficulty conversing about very detailed, niche topics. For example, if you're discussing the specific arguments scholars or scientiests are making in books or articles, ChatGPT struggles to go deeper than the wavetops. It definitely can't point out good references.",
