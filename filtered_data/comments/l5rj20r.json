    "body": "LOL exactly. Or the U2 album they forced on everyone. When will they learn that just because you have 2 billion people to impose a new product on doesn't mean that product will be widely adopted? You need more than that base. You need to be \\*listening\\* to that base. Jobs famously said the customer doesn't know what they want until you show it to them. But that was before the information overload age, before users were savvy enough to find workarounds and even invent their own products, before they had access to so much beyond a single company. I can't imagine this Siri update leading me to delete my ChatGPT app, especially once real-time voice chat goes public.",
