    "body": "Every time people start loosing jobs to new technology/machine automation the same cycle happens. It happened with uber/lyft vs. taxi industry, car manufacturing vs. automation assembly lines, amazon vs. bookstores, typewriter vs pen&paper.  \n  \nIf you fail to adapt than its a skill issue. It's easier to blame technological advancement and automation for your failure than to improve your skill set in order to anticipate market demand and future proof your career.   \n  \nChatGpt and its growth has not only propelled us into the future by 10-20 years by ensuring ease of access to reliable information that would otherwise be coveted and pay walled by through so many barriers. It has drastically improved so many aspects of my life whether it be financial, legal, business or health with the information at the tip of my fingertips.  \n  \nI view ChatGpt as a flashlight you carry while walking at night, it can show you the different paths you can take, but its up to you to decide whether you will walk them or not.",
