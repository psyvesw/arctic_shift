    "body": "I'm 100% with you on this one. Reading to your child is about the time spent with your child, not what you're reading. Ever gotten the request, \"can you tell me a story about a robot that goes to the moon?\" I have, and honestly, I'm garbage at making that stuff up on the fly.\n\nOne of the things I do with my kids is have them help me build stories using ChatGPT. They get to pick the theme, names of characters, and they love that they get a story that they wanted. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad, but it's a fun experience because it leads to a conversation. \"Oh, you want a robot that goes to the moon? Can I name him Gus? Do you think he has a friend with him?\"  \n\nThe bonus is I get to teach them about AI and what it's doing. My hope is that they'll have a better understanding of how it works and how they can use it.",
