My professor did an experiment because he could tell every single student in his class used it for their homework but he didn\u2019t say anything the entire semester. At the end he told all 25 students in class \u201cI can tell who\u2019s been using chat gpt for their homework BUT if you confess by email within 24 hours of this class announcement I won\u2019t fail anyone for cheating.\u201d He said he got an email from all 25 students confessing to it LMAO",
