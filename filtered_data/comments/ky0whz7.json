    "body": "Oof, any tool that enables teachers to do their job without requiring them to actually know anything is a good thing in my book. Students are there to learn, if the teacher thinks Ai is a shortcut that diminishes the quality of learning a student can obtain them it explains the question entirely.\n\nAlso, life isn't fair. Grow up. Why go to school at all if you don't agree with how it's being run. I'm my mind going to school is the way you learn to play a societal game. It's a development period that has unpredictable outcomes. The teachers are really just trying to influence the outcome of their own ideal. Most of the things students learn in school aren't necessarily written into the curriculum.",
