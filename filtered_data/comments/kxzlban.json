    "body": "I can see what you\u2019re arguing, and I\u2019m not actually against your point, I\u2019m not an anarchist after all.\n\nSince we seem to agree on the realistic concern of people behind AI, I suppose we can dive right into the theoretical things we appear to differ.\n\nI can see why that goal is appealing, but in my opinion, that goal is just impossible. Now, maybe this is a difference caused by how we define perfect, but my understanding of arguing for the existence of a \u2018perfect shape of society\u2019 is arguing for a system that is:\n\ni. Qualitatively the best, what standard do we use is a question for another day, and;\n\nii. Unchanging in both temporal and spatial sense, that is, it\u2019s permanent and universal, it\u2019ll still be the best system under that standard for even human colonists on the Moon in year 2332.\n\nIf changes are still needed, then that means it\u2019s not perfect since it can still be improved. This is the thing I\u2019m having a problem with.\n\nSociety just changes.\u00a0Even if we put aside all other factors, just look at AI itself. Tech changes society radically, so, to have a perfect society, we\u2019ll need to either stop having technological advancements, or have foreknowledge for not yet discovered scientific knowledge, innovations, and inventions. Otherwise, tech changes will inevitably lead to changes in the economic structure, which then lead to changes in the power of each socio-economic class, and then, of course, which class is being dominant will promote their values as the correct values to have, and so on.\n\nI\u2019m not against the idea of a perfect society due to universality being impossible, I\u2019m against it because it requires determinism, it\u2019s temporally impossible.",
