    "body": "Number 3 is part of why I dont think a 'doomsday' scenerio isn't likely anytime soon. \n\nEveryone imagines existing narratives where you have a single AGI like 'Skynet', it is turned on, and thats it, we're fucked.\n\nBut in reality over the course of a year we now have a few major LLMs and thousands of basement LLMs. These inventions grow together; so eventually yeah there will be a single AGI- but soon after there will be several- then thousands.\n\nAnd their capabilities will grow in tandem, much like how computer viruses and anti-virus capabilities grow together. If we dropped a hacker with today's understanding back 30 years ago- they likely could shut down every networked computer on earth if they wanted, but that's not the case. As new virus strategies are made, new defense strategies are made.\n\nWhen an AGI is born- it will still be in its infancy, and by the time the tech is capable of a 'Skynet' level event. We will have thousands of other AGI and likely several dozen \"Defender\" type AGI that are able to act against it. \n\nI can absolutely see some major infrastructure issues happening due to a rogue AI in the future- but only on a micro level, something like towns or companies being fucked up because of an incident- but on a global level it seems very unlikely.",
