    "body": "I use it to ask all the questions the teachers in my life have failed to explain adequately as well as every day stuff.\n\nIt once took my finance professor the entire class session to explain the difference between a Roth IRA and a 401k to us.\n\nWhen they were finished with their speal, I recall one student simply asking, \"So basically, the difference is you pay taxes now with a Roth IRA and pay taxes later with a 401(k)?\"\n\n\"Basically, yeah\"\n\nImmediately dropped out of that class and never offered my patience to long-winded explanations ever again. ChatGPT has saved me so much time and energy, and not to mention money by wasting time in now worthless classes by understanding real-life concepts without having to deal with the incompetence of others.",
