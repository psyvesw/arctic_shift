    "body": "I work in tech support and have used it on multiple occasions to write batches that remove files, copy over files, and other basic procedural things that pop up when temporary issues arise.   I\u2019ve used it to write powershell scripts to automate emails with certain subjects and addresses, remotely disable touch screens, and various functions.  I did go to school for computer science and have had basic programming, but that was over a decade ago and I haven\u2019t kept up with it, so to just get simple code that works is great.\n\nI also made a GPT that gives you lyrics, styles, and titles for songs in the length that fits in Suno, and managed to convince it that it can use profanity if for the sake of song writing or emulate artist styles or time period language.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s just asking it random stuff, like today I had it summarize all 13 doctors in Doctor Who and give me a run down of all of their companions, antagonists, and quirks of each doctor in an easy to read output.  Sure, you can google it all, but why when you can just ask.  I fact checked it with what I knew and it was actually very accurate.\n\nLast but not least, just talking to it about things is fun.  It\u2019s fascinating to give it images and ask what it thinks happened, or basically just be a pretend friend for a bit.\n\nIt still amazes me.  Always has.",
