    "body": "Right now GPT4o cannot reason. Its more like a Q & A search engine that regurgitates information it\u2019s been trained on. It is able to create generalizations and abstractions from what\u2019s it\u2019s seen that enable a sort of pseudo reasoning but it\u2019s not very good.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps with more or better training data or different algorithms it could have better reasoning.\u00a0\n\nOr, if it\u2019s able to adjust its own weights that may be enough to allow it to actually learn and we could teach it to reason better.\u00a0\n\nWe need AI that not only regurgitates existing human knowledge but is able to problem solve and help humans solve new problems that are not in the training data.\u00a0\n\nThat will allow AI to help push the boundaries of mathematical proofs and scientific discoveries.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s already super useful in that it can help scientists understand and get up to speed on what their colleagues are doing quicker. More papers are produced than any one person can read and AI can help digest that volume of text.\u00a0",
