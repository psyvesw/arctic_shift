    "body": "You are correct, the ChatGPT model has no record of text that you sent it. The data used to train it and the conversations it has after training are completely separate.\n\nBe careful: this doesn\u2019t protect you from the usual ways that \u201cAI Detectors\u201d mess up. As I said above, an AI detector might flag you for your choice of language and sentence structure. I\u2019ve also seen cases of professors sending excerpts of a student\u2019s text and asking \u201cdid you write this?\u201d, to which ChatGPT is equally likely to answer \u201cyes\u201d as it is \u201cno\u201d. But you have no control over those; your safest defense against AI false positives is to keep proof that you wrote the text yourself, such as writing it in google docs where every change is tracked down to the minute.",
