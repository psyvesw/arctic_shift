    "body": "I've had the same experience when I demonstrate the incredible capabilities to other non-enthusiasts. I've lived through the adoption of pretty much all of the technology we use today and adoption and understanding was usually slow. Personal computers, email, internet, google search. However, AI has the ability to be much more impactful and people who don't use the leverage that it offers will fall far behind those that do. \n\nI wish OpenAI would release some of the vaporware they announced recently. I'm getting some ankle rehab and heard the PT trying to interact with a Spanish woman. I mentioned the upcoming language translator and of course she never heard of it. It would have been awesome to have been able to pull out my phone and let her use it. Instant convert!",
