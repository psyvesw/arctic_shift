    "body": "A couple of my professors have rules about ChatGPT. One forbids it entirely because it's a composition class that's all about learning how to write an essay so fair enough. She also said if she caught you using an assignment for another class in her class, she would also mark it as cheating. However, one assignment had the option to do a visual poster and she linked some AI tools to help with layout, so she's not totally against AI, probably just felt that using it would defeat the purpose of the course.\n\nHistory class says you can use it as a jumping off point if you're stuck on analyzing the primary source text, but to cite the AI and explain why you agree or disagree (she showed one example where the bot was hilariously wrong and the student caught it and explained how wrong). It was outright forbidden for two major projects, though.\n\nMy anthropology teacher counted it as cheating for some assignments where the point was to practice research and summarize sources on your own. Other assignment technically allowed for AI use of cited, but there was either a visual element as emphasis (such as making something) or it was summarizing a documentary so in that case I think it was more \"you can use AI to make your notes more coherent\"\n\nSo some teachers are adapting. But I think context is key here. Like I do think that there's some cases where using AI is missing the point and gaining nothing from the class.",
