    "body": "Yeah, I just haven't found a way to work it into my everyday/professional life yet. I'm a musician (career musician, not just a side-thing), and to my knowledge, it can't help me with anything yet. I make my money primarily by performing, which it of course can't do. And also by writing arrangements of previously written songs for other people to perform for shows with different instrumentation, styles, roadmaps, etc. That one, AI would be helpful in if it could transcribe a piece for me so I don't have to do it by ear. But as far as I know, it's use in music is still very limited. Just writing its own music, which doesn't apply to me. \n\nSo right now, I pretty much use it as a glorified search engine, troubleshooting equipment in some hobbies, and occasionally as a tutor when I'm learning a new program or trying to make my website. \n\nThe only thing giving me hope of not being left behind, is that I do actually know about it and have some sort of functional use of it, even if I'm not on the cutting edge. While others that I talk to haven't even heard of it. So maybe I won't be a cutting edge expert, but maybe I also won't just be super illiterate and left out. \n\nThe faster it moves, the more worried I get about keeping up though.",
