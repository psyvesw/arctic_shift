A PhD student at Princeton University, Tianle Cai, discovered that the tokens used by the model to parse Chinese prompts were predominantly related to gambling and pornography. The presence of these inappropriate tokens could potentially lead to hallucinations, poor performance, and misuse.Experts suggest that the issue stems from insufficient data cleaning and filtering before the tokenizer was trained. This could allow users to trick the chatbot into generating incorrect answers or even bypassing safety guardrails.\n\n\nReport by Link Report LinkReport.ai\nsource: https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/05/17/1092649/gpt-4o-chinese-token-polluted/",
