    "body": "I would use AI assistants more.. but (and I hate how I sound like an old guy \"get off my lawn\" when I say this).. but they still feel very \"tinker-toys\" (elementary school level) to me. \n\n* for the small answers,.. I still have to go double-check or independently verify them,.. so it's not really saving me much time or effort. \n\n* for larger or more nebulous questions,.. often I find there's no AI assistant that really understands the larger context of the problem. (especially problems where there may be multiple different answers, depending on your individual priorities). \n\nIf I ask for the physical address of a business,.. I want the response to give me the address,. but (contextually) I also want it to be aware of the bigger picture:\n\n* If the particular business I'm asking about is not open on Sundays (and I'm asking on Sunday).. then I'd expect the AI response to tell me \"blah blah blah address,. and just note this business is not open on Sundays!\"\n\n* Or if there was a recent News article about that Business opening up a new branch near me,. I'd hope the AI would notice that as well and let me know. \n\nAs it stands now,. It still kinda feels like a hollow or empty \"fact-repeater\". There doesn't really feel like there's any awareness or intelligence.",
