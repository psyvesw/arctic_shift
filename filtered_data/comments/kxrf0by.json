    "body": "Two or three possibilities. One is that the abstract sections language in general is very AI like. Second, maybe because I use grammarly (and I accept some or many of its suggestions). Third, maybe because English isn't my first language, so my writing style (in academia) seems robotic.\n\n\nFor the first explanation, we need to test abstracts written before AI. This might prove or disprove the hypothesis.\n\n\nFor the second explanation, I once tried to turn off grammarly completely and made many edits, but the AI score went up at one time! :) I wish I have saved these tests (because I spent a couple hours trying to bring the freaking score down, then I gave up and submitted the paper as is). This looks funny now, but back then I was very stressed to submit the proposal in time.\n\n\nThe third explanation seems the most likely one in my case. As I mentioned already, many paragraphs or even sections of my old papers are flagged. Maybe the detectors are flagging them because of the excessive use of \"moreover\", \"however\", \"on the other hand\", \"in summary\".\u00a0",
