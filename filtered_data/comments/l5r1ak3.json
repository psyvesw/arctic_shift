    "body": "i'm actually backing down quite a bit these days. I was the teacher in my school last year who ran around and demonstrated and proselytized to everyone who would listen. A small handful teachers got it; others didn't.\n\nI live to this already. I was around when the Web got started in the 90s.  Worked in the software industry. It took a long time for mom and pop and Joe and Jane Average to even get email.  Gmail didn't even come out until 2004! I'd say it took between 10 and 15 years for a widespread adoption of web technology to really make it through even first world countries.  OpenAI says they have 100 million users: that's a real small percentage of the worldwide population.\n\nWe are the early adopters ... it's gonna take a while before people catch up to where we are.",
