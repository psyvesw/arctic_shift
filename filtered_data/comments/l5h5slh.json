    "body": "Isn't the ultimate test to see how similar they are is to analyze the Sky voice to Scarlett Johansson's voice using a voice analysis program like Praat? Perceptual analysis (comparing the two using your ear) is going to be the lowest tier of evidence as there will be a high degree of variability between raters and even among the same raters across time/trials. So, analyze the voices/sound waves to compare and contrast the actual qualities of the sound wave. Fundamental frequency, formants (raw numbers), compare the actual waveform/spectrogram. And anything else relevant. You just two samples of speech that are as close to the same as possible. Typically, a sustained \"a\" is what I use for clients, across multiple trials, but I'm sure someone out there can find two speech sound samples that are comparable and use gpt to figure out the rest. Praat is free too, so, GL.",
