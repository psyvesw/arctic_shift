    "body": "This is AI coming for a particular subset of jobs, particularly stock art. Overall, I see these tools absolutely both upleveling the entire art space, as well as growing the entire pool of artists.\n\nIt's like how we have *way* more shitty programs and programmers nowadays compared to the 70s, both in relative and absolute terms, due to how accessible high level languages like Python and JavaScript are. And yet we have, in absolute terms, *vastly* many more good programmers today as well too, and so many more useful programs.\n\nI'm happy to relinquish the pool of stock art jobs if it means seeing the growth of higher quality and more meaningful art jobs. One-man commissions for stock art will transition pretty naturally to one-man YouTube videography shops, and many more YT videos will be able to have animation quality more similar to Kurzgesagt or Crash Course.\n\nIf that means we're going to get some bottom-of-the-barrel, low quality stock art from companies with no quality bar whatsoever, I think that tradeoff, while occasionally certainly frustrating, is okay overall.",
