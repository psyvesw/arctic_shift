I was also part of their trio, and the person writing the apology letter was very clingy, manipulative, and dishonest during our friendship. This apology letter just shows how insincere they are. Not to mention, I\u2019ve been in multiple classes with that person and they use ai for everything. And not everything I mean everything, and they somehow have not been caught by the teacher. We have tried to talk to the \u201cfriend\u201d because we worry about her future since we\u2019re her friends of course, but she only got more defensive and lashed out as us like we were at help.",
