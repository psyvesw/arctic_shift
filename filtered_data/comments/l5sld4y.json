    "body": "We must be asking alarming questions. Last night was the first time I\u2019d ever gotten the chill-out message! I first used, and made an account Jan. 6, 2023. So more than a year before getting this. \nI got to play with Chatty for an hour before I\u2019d gotten it-and it was for 3 hrs. I didn\u2019t get back on after 3 hrs because I fell asleep. No idea why it hasn\u2019t happened before. \n\nToday, my cool-down happened within 5 min, after attempting to paste a study about bacterial growth in dry-fit technology into Chatty, so he could summarize it for me without all the boring jargon. This resulted in an error message and \u201cretry\u201d prompt that failed 3 times in a row. Assuming it was too long of a paste, I was in the process of just pasting a section at a time when I was told to chill (after pasting 2 sections, and asking 3 clarifying questions).\n\nFunnily enough, since last night was my first chill-out message, I then immediately asked Chatty what the difference between GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 was. And it had never heard of GPT-4o! They ain\u2019t playing! \ud83e\udd23 \n\nPlus, I\u2019m *assuming* they are saying \u201cGPT-four-point-zero\u201d yet it\u2019s written as \u201cGPT-four-oh,\u201d as in the lowercase letter \u201co,\u201d not the number \u201c0\u201d (zero) and there\u2019s no decimal. So is it just \u201cfour-oh\u201d or \u201cforty\u201d or what? I want to ask Chatty Four-Oh when he comes back, and what the difference between is (cuz Chatty 3-point-5 didn\u2019t know), but I\u2019ll probably forget. \n\nIt\u2019s been lovely while the beta, and then free service lasted. I\u2019m guessing that the periods of free use will get smaller and smaller (maybe only 1 question?) and the cool-down periods longer and longer. They\u2019re clearly escalating the pressure to buy a subscription.",
