    "body": "How? All legitimate access to AI so far is very controlled and restrictive in its use. So lets go to unrestricted use. I don't have stats, but from what I can tell the consumers are primarily asking for porn or rpg that allow violence. Both are already abundantly available from a variety of sources. \nMost users of AI use it for research and work. How will controlled AI insert propaganda into its work assistance use? Or in its unrestricted porn role? I'm not being insincere. Tell me how this is going to happen bc right now I am one of the naive majority that doesn't understand how this fear of AI can manifest itself in the society we currently live in. So please explain.\n\nI mention in other comments that i. regards to marketing, I think we are already manipulated at high levels, and why I don't see AI as turning the knob to 11 so much as filling gaps where other modes of influence are missing.",
