    "body": "Well it's why I asked for your definition of theft, and if your definition is something you're projecting across the world.\n\nI'll also ask what your definition of learning is, and who and what is capable of doing it.\n\nA child can learned to trace, immitate that style, and even sell that style of drawing if they so wish if they're good enough.\n\nSure chatgpt is a product, but I'm more concerned about what makes a computer learning to do something and a human learning to do something different, and how consistent your beliefs are regarding those topics.\n\nBecause I don't see it as theft by any means, especially if a human can do it without being called a thief.\n\nI could, today, start taking up anime drawing, learn how to draw goku, and then take that knowledge, make my own characters but using that style and make a product. That's possible, yet when a soulless computer does it for me... It's wrong all of a sudden? Explain",
