    "body": "Interesting case, I'll wait for the comment by the makers, because there could be a variety of things going on.\n\nFor what it's worth, the documentary mentions that Jennifer forged a lot of her documents in Photoshop (in order to fool her parents into thinking she goes to a certain school etc.) If that's true, then these may be self-released photos by her which are also photoshopped.\n\nDo I consider that likely? No, it doesn't make sense to me, really, especially because the edits don't look like beauty edits. But neither would using AI in an otherwise good documentary make any sense -- and then using it in such an obvious way.\n\nMaybe these artifacts have yet another source altogether. Let's see how this evolves!",
