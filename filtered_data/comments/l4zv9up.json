    "body": "OpenAI have to realise that many of their customers are not teenagers, some of us are in late middle age. I'd like an Ian McKellan (Gandalf) voice. Sky was the only one even approaching a mature voice, the others are sassy or some buddy for a 20 year old to go bike riding with, and of course, the obligatory NonB. I was loving this, now forget it.\n\nAnd if the news reports of what Johansen is saying are accurate, then lady, it isn't all about you. Yes I'm a \"dude\" but also a 60 year old cancer survivor with troubled grown kids. I don't want to \"get off\" on talking to you (and no, the AI voice sounds nothing like you imo) I just want to be able to talk to the worlds knowledge base in a mature and grown up way.\n\nNow unless something changes, \"congratulations OpenAI, you ruined AI\" and I'm gone.",
