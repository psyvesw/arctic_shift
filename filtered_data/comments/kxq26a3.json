    "body": "I have a subscription for Perplexity and use it extensively. And I also use Claude 3 Opus.\n\nPerplexity is easily my #1 research assistant. In fact, I'm trying to develop prompts that aid in media literacy (mostly my own) by leveraging it's ability to summarize research results. But I'm also a student and have used it to research for papers I had to write. What I like the subscription is that I can use GPT4, Claude 3 Opus or Sonnet, or a bunch of other models. [Here's a recent review](https://old.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1brim76/is_the_pro_version_worth_it/kx9q7oo/) I gave about why I like Perplexity so much.\n\nClaude 3 Opus is excellent for outlining. I used to think Claude 2 was okay, with ChatGPT being slightly better. But Opus is on another level. Again, as a student, I'm expected to have chapters read. Opus has cut down my reading time considerably (I basically read the outlines of the chapters it generates rather than the chapter lol). It's also helpful for writing, as you mentioned. I don't use for academic writing (I'm genuinely invested in learning stuff), but I use for my planned blog. Claude does okay turning at outline in semi-coherent blog post that needs considerable editing, imo.",
