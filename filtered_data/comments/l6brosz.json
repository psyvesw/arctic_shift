    "body": "I was around at the start of the internet, and it feels similar.  In the early days, It really was just the academic world.  Then us interested and slightly geeky people started and we started to get some interesting websites and some tools started to be more mainstream (search engines, aggregator sites, portals).  But still it was only a few percent of the population that used it regularly.\nThis is where we are now with AI.  \n\nThen shopping, porn and chat started, and that\u2019s what really started to move the needle.  There was something for almost everyone, and we were also getting faster modems and better connections.\n\nEarly days, and the AI tools we have today really aren\u2019t that useful to the average person.  Sure, you can ask chatGPT questions, but it isn\u2019t much of a better result than search engines and collating it yourself.  Image creation is cool, but how often do you need to create an image really?  It can help with some tasks like coding, and might be good for repetitive tasks, or things that have been done many times before, but not really great for creating something truly new.\n\nWhen we can give it compound tasks and it has the connections to carry out the tasks, it will start to be adopted widely.  \u201cUse Unity to create a 3D world based on early Rome.  Populate it with NPC\u2019s from that time period\u201d.  \u201cCreate a marketing campaign for my hamburger restaurant - create video spots for youtube, coupons, etc.\u201d  (Not great examples but you get the drift\n\nInteresting times to be around for sure!",
