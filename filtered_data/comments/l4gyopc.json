    "body": "You're mad about the update rollout not being as smooth as butter but just chill out for a second. We're talking about a global deployment here. You act like OpenAI has a magic wand to make everything perfect instantly. Updates Can be messy.\n\nYou want your subscription back because you didn't get the exact feature you wanted right away? Sure,m go ahead but let's be real for a minute the world doesn't revolve around your impatience or anyone elses. The update is coming just like they said. If you can't handle a bit of wait time maybe you need to rethink how you deal with tech. Everything's evolving getting better. The slow responses you\u2019re whining about? Temporary.\n\nLet them roll out the update properly and stop acting like you\u2019ve been personally wronged by the universe. The world doesn\u2019t owe you instant gratification. Learn some patience and enjoy the improvements when they come.",
