    "body": ">If I take some free educational courses, I might put someone who actually paid for school out of a job\n\nHow? Expand this point please. Are you suggesting that you could take a free course and then compete against someone who paid for a degree? Because we have guardrails against that too, that's the entire point of why you need to prove your credentials and where you got them from. A degree in Math is not the same as a free course in math, nor could you ever attempt to pretend it is because academia has always been rigorous against this. \n\n  \nI think you're argument rests on your opinion that AI produces original works and I don't think it does. It's an algorithm, it literally has no judgement it's just spitting out stuff procedurally. That's why hallucinations are such a problem, where there are millions of sources saying Elon musk is alive and yet the AI spits out that he's dead. That's unusable in my opinion. A pitiful result for something that ate so much data without permission and is desperate for even more. \n\n  \nThere's an alternate world where AI is being created ethically, collectively and with the support of those that could feed the algorithm best. We do not live in that world and I'm honestly expecting AI to get a lot worse as companies start looking over their shoulders and suing the shit out of AI companies. Unless Getty images loses, then it'll be the wild west as websites try to protect themselves from scraping. We'll see.",
