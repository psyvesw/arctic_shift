There\u2019s a lot of research being done on robotics and the new AI control systems to power them (see boston dynamics and also Tesla, google, openAI, etc. are also working towards building smart robots). \n\nThis is literally only possible now due to the recent AI advancements, since a crucial part has always been the control software and it\u2019s embodiment, which needed much more advanced vision models (as well as for other sensory inputs) to be able to navigate the physical world effectively. The \u201cAI doodles\u201d are the product of the cutting edge computer vision research, which is part of what is necessary for creating a truly useful house helper robot, than can do more general tasks than what a dishwasher or laundry machine does.\n\nWe are finally creating digital brains that will allow our machines to be more flexible, yet your ignorance blinds you and makes you cast aspersions at things you do not even understand.",
