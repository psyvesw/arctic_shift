    "body": "I don't code but I'm a graphic designer and use GPT 4 so much that I would confidently say that about 40% of my work is Ai generated (obviously tweeked and modified by me). \n\nI mostly make children's academic books and those require a bunch of illustration work, which done by hand takes A LOT of time. Thanks to Dalee I was able to reduce illustration time around 70% (I still have to heavily modify what Dalee spits out but it's much faster than doing it from scratch). Recently I attempted to do illustrations by myself and realized that I have become way slower than I was a year ago which was a bit concerning.",
