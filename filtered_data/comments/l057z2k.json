    "body": "Hi, thanks for the kind words. I am a web developer with over five years of experience, and for the last three years, I have done a lot of data visualizations, so I could write it by myself. It would probably take more time, but still. For this project, I used a tech stack I had never worked with before (Next.js) and needed to study the documentation extensively to formulate the proper prompts. I even copied the entire documentation of this technology and created a custom GPT with these docs as a knowledge base to make my life a bit easier.\n\nNevertheless, I learned a lot through making it\u2014it took about three months from start to finish. Now I know how to distribute tasks according to the computational limitations of the user and how to use some machine learning libraries on the frontend, so it was worth my time. But the most interesting part of this project was that it simply works\u2014I was able to generate an image of myself and, after the generation process, I looked at this image for more than 20 minutes.",
