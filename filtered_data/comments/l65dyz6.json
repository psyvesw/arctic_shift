    "body": "I think memory is the biggest one for me - I find ChatGPT great once I have given it all of the relevant information and parameters, but this can be time consuming and also sometimes it is hard to foresee gaps that I may have left out in trying to get useful outputs. For example, if you are using ChatGPT over time to assist you with a body of work or even how to reply to certain emails or make decisions, it would be more human-like if it could build up a memory bank of inputs you have provided over a long period of time. \n\nOf course the downside of this is then you have to be careful of all inputs you ever put into ChatGPT so you don\u2019t undermine/taint its memory with information that is not reflective of the outputs you want. But this could be circumvented if perhaps there were segmented GPTs (e.g. a memory one and a non-memory one)",
