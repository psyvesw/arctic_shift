    "body": "But AI can already do them at the undergraduate level if you're talking about solving given problems.\n\nWhat it can't do is reason and perform research. It's going to have hard time deriving proof of derivative if that wasn't included in it's training data and it's going to have hard time coming up with Cavendish experiment and setting it up to find gravitational constant if it wasn't in it's data set.\n\nBut all of those require advanced thinking skills - reasoning, research, experimentation, critical thinking. And those things are very sparsely taught in school. Most of the school today is \"how to solve a known problem\" not \"how to solve an unknown problem\".",
