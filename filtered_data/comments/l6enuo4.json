    "body": "> Omg. the creation and consumption of artificial child sexual abuse imagery can normalize and desensitize individuals to the exploitation and abuse of children. \n\n\u2026I mean, that makes sense to _me._ But you can\u2019t just assert that without evidence. We don\u2019t actually know if that\u2019s true.\n\n> Even if no real children are harmed in the production of such images, they contribute to a culture that trivializes and condones sexual violence against minors.\n\nI mean\u2026 maybe? I really wouldn\u2019t say we have a culture that \u2018condones sexual violence against minors\u2019, considering that it\u2019s pretty universally considered to even be worse than _murder._ You need to back this one up as well.\n\n> Not to mention the psychological harm that can result from the proliferation of these images. Knowing that such material exists can be distressing and triggering for survivors of child sexual abuse, \n\nSure. That makes sense.\n\n> as well as for concerned individuals who may fear for the safety of children in their communities.\n\nThis, however, relies on the idea that there is a causative relationship between even AI-generated CSAM and actual rape.\n\nBecause not all child rapists are pedophiles, you know.\n\n> And the potential for artificial imagery to serve as a gateway to the actual abuse of children. Research has shown that individuals who consume child sexual abuse material are more likely to progress to committing hands-on offenses against children.\n\n[\u2026No.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_child_pornography_and_child_sexual_abuse) We don\u2019t know that. The science is mixed on that issue. It\u2019s hard to prove a causative relationship.\n\n> Laws that criminalize the creation and dissemination of artificial child sexual abuse imagery send a clear message that society will not tolerate the exploitation and victimization of minors, regardless of whether real children are involved.\n\n\u2026What the fuck? See, this is what I\u2019m talking about. Jesus. No minors are being exploited in AI-generated CSAM because no minors are involved.\n\nIf no real children are involved, its creation, by definition, cannot be exploitation. It\u2019s continued _existence,_ however, could be- if you compare it to existing laws around \u2018revenge porn\u2019, maybe. It\u2019s very nebulous, legally.\n\nWe\u2019ve already basically confirmed that shit like \u2018lolicon\u2019 is at the very least _legal_ (for better or for worse), and AI-generated content can easily be seen as an extension of that. So, it\u2019s hard to say what should be done.\n\n> I don\u2019t see how I had to explain this to you, but my argument isn\u2019t terrible.\n\nMost of the things you\u2019ve argued here are new claims. Your previous arguments were much worse.\n\n> Your lack of understanding and respect towards children is concerning and terrible.\n\n_Stop being an asshole._",
