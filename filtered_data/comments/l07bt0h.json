    "body": "The more information is available on the internet the stupider people got on average. So many teens are illiterate or have extremely poor grammar even though they have all the fucking tools to have correct grammar. Lot of them can't even tie together sentences so it would make sense. Many people also say \"why should I learn this if it is available on my phone?\" which will just get even worse with AI. Hell, we already have people writing their college exams and other things with AI, eventually people will become dumb as shit as 99% of people will refuse to learn anything because AI knows everything anyway. In the end we'll communicate like neanderthals by barely grunting or gesturing shit lmao",
