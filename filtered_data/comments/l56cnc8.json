    "body": "(Last line is basically a TL;DR summary.)  \n  \nBeen doing data-oriented design for my software projects recently. ONLY AN HOUR AGO, I was discussing some software design things with it (as I always do with ChatGPT, and GPT-3.5 acts as a great rubber duck that gives good generic advice that is *of course* worst to follow, but hey - at least I can explain my code to *somebody* who actually knows things and *tries* to understand it!...), and then, I go on to describe my data model to it. I ask it to draw my model in ASCII and it draws this triple-pointer thing perfectly! I then show it some code here and there, ask it about another problem, then show it my C code with empty functions that are yet to be implemented (2/11 were written), and it went on to write PERFECT code in ONE SHOT. None of my 6 linters complained seeing ANY of it. It was *actually* good C code - something that GPT-3.5 messed up so badly that you'd best call *\"all unsafe code\"*. It even picked up my style of DOING THINGS - not just my naming conventions, but also my STYLES and CHECKS! All because I gave it my data model 3 prompts ago!\n\n  \nNow... it's AI generated code at the end of the day, and I'm only *studying* what it did - it didn't do good enough for my requirements, and reviewing a bug that I wrote is better haha. ...And I like to write my stuff myself. It's best to train myself to be able to work with LLMs when they get better LOL.  \n  \nBut... yeah! It wrote C code that none of my 6 linters complained about!",
