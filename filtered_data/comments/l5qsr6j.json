    "body": "See, I'm sitting here thinking OP is asking if AI will replace tutoring 1 for 1. \n\nTruly, what you're doing is amazing and a great way to show these kids the opportunities available to them. However, I don't think what you're doing is tutoring. It may be an introduction to student led tutoring, and some students may gravitate toward it for help. In those scenarios, I think it would replace tutoring. \n\nI still don't think many kids are going to use it on their own volition to help with schoolwork. I know my child self wouldn't have. I avoided schoolwork. It wasn't a course material issue, it was an attention issue. I couldn't keep myself focused for long enough to get the work done, and I was smart enough to know that if I did try that, I'd spend every waking hour doing schoolwork. \n\nChatGPT isn't going to help kids that are like I was develop diligence and discipline. We can however use guided tutoring to help develop those traits in them. I don't think parents are going to sit with their kids as they ask ChatGPT questions and make sure they stay on topic.\n\nAgain, I hope I'm wrong. Maybe kids that grow up alongside AI will be different. I grew up alongside the internet, with similarly easy access to information, and still didn't use it as a replacement for tutoring.",
