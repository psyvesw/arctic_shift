    "body": "Unfortunately, AI tends to exaggerate the bias it finds in the training data.\n\nFor example: Let's say there are 5 communities (as you called it). However, one of them is so big that they create 70% of the content on a specific topic. If you then instruct an AI to write on that specific topic, it would tend to write 100% of responses in line with this major community. That is because it is trained on writing a \"realistic\" response, or something that a human is likely to say. And since it's best chance at writing a \"good\" response is being in line with that community, it will choose to do so because it gives the highest reward.\n\nBecause of this, it is actually normal (and usually preferential) to fight bias in your training data.\n\nI'm not saying what OpenAI (and all the other LLM providers) are doing is the best way, as they are seemingly censoring their AIs rather than adjusting training data. But I do think it is necessary to tweak the responses to a certain degree.",
