    "body": "I definitely would not downplay this at all. Give it a decade, there won\u2019t be an artist in the world who isn\u2019t augmenting their creative process with tools like this. Quite honestly I think there\u2019s going to be tremendous social resentment/upheaval/pushback because of it, in ways that are reminiscent of other technologies that rendered specialized knowledge and training obsolete. \n\nIt reminds me a little bit of the development of musketry in the age of swords. An individual could spend a lifetime practicing technique and learning the fine details of swordsmanship, and then one day he finds himself in the heat of combat about to deploy those years of training and practice, only to be knocked off by a single shot from some peasant with a long rifle standing a few hundred feet away.\n\nI can definitely see how this is shaping up to be the same thing, except across nearly every domain. There will be those who adopt and embrace the new tools and learn to harness their power; and those who stodge along with a stiff neck to it all and resist the inevitable changes only to find themselves out mastered one day.\n\nI don\u2019t believe AI like this is going to replace jobs en masse\u2014I believe the people who harness it effectively are going to be the ones doing the replacing.\n\nAmazing track, thanks OP for sharing. Don\u2019t understand how anyone could downplay this, it\u2019s pretty remarkable, even with the nuanced AI telltales.",
