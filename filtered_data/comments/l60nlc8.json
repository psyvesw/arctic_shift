    "body": "Well, I guess it's blown way out of proportion with a lot of doomer thinking. If clear passwords are being sent to the cloud, of course that's bad.\n\nBut if it is like Rewind.ai, then it's totally fine. It's a tool my ADHD mind would dearly miss if I can't use it anymore.\nIt screenrecords everything (also audio which is then transcribed), uses OCR for everything that is readable in the video and creates a searchable database in a local encrypted file. Passwords won't be saved, because when you type passwords in fields, you mostly see the dots instead of the input and that's what would be saved in the local file. It would only be saved if you click and make it visible.\n\nAlso it's only saved locally and encrypted, things would only be sent to the cloud once you use the chatbot integration which you don't have to, you could only use the search withing the local file.",
