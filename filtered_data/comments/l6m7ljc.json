    "body": "Not at all! I am working on large outsourcing company and we are doing quite an extensive research on how AI can solve different tasks. And for some subset of tasks it is quite efficient already. In your post you did not specify which tasks did you try and with which result, with which prompt, with which model? Did you check for nerfed(throttled) instance case? Also whether you are framework developer or write complex new algorithms? Some 90%+ developers nowadays are framework developers, like react, Net, spring, etc. Those frameworks are developed to solve specific problems and evolved along with its community desires and trends of those days. People who spent with those frameworks years of their lives and literally memorised ways of doing things, know by heart all the bugs, etc. And now many of them challenge LLMs on that they cannot compete in some niche specifics of days to day application of those frameworks. My take is that: \n1. Framework development is the most routine and simple type of software engineering. It will be automated in next 2-5 years completely and all engaged in it will be either dismissed or learn other types of software engineering \n2. Software engineers will be still irreplaceable for a long span of time. But only those who work on new algorithms, protocols and other useful things. For all routine tasks and even on some R&D they will heavily rely on AI assistance\n3. Will 90% of engineers who do frameworks now will loose job? Not necessarily, humankind is good at inventing new trivial jobs. It is that those jobs will be grounded on new frontiers",
