    "body": "I am a third grade teacher and tried exactly this with the story my students wrote. I had them read their stories out loud and ChatGPT gave them feedback (i made sure to give a good prompt). In a next step they were buddied up and tasked to be super critical with the feedback and work on their stories with the feedback given. They achieved pretty great results. They were allowed to generate two pictures. After the first one I told them to add more vivid details to their story to make the pictures look more like the scenes in their head and well...It worked like a charm. I never have seen them so engaged and happy to do second and third drafts on their stories. Usually they hate working on them because their work does not feel validated. It was so awesome seeing their stories come to life.",
