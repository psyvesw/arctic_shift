    "body": "Finally, someone came up with this answer. Turnitin was designed as a tool for some instances of plagiarism, but it is still helpful for old-school plagiarism techniques. \n\nThere are a couple of problems here:\n1) Most AI detection tools are rubbish, especially public ones. What about universities encouraging the usage of tools like Grammarly?  How about paraphrasing? \n\n2) Those worried about their data should also consider the services they use to check for plagiarism. Especially the free ones; even before chatbots, people have been using those services for a long time, not to mention other writing services run by humans. \n\nAnd while talking about academia.... \n\nLet's not forget the Elsevier incident as well.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/1beit4y/obvious_chatgpt_in_a_published_paper/",
