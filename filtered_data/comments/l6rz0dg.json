    "body": "I still don't think you quite understand. Nobody listens to my music in the first place. The only time I get plays is if I promote the shit out of stuff. The people who aren't connected to me through socials aren't going to ever find my stuff. \n\nI do not make music because I think other people are going to listen to it. I make music because it's fun to make music. I improve because I want to get better at something. \n\nComputers can already play chess way better then most of humanity, but people still learn how to play chess. \n\nThe people making money off of music are either really lucky, really dedicated to promoting, or really rich. The second string are people who make money selling classes and packs and presets and samples, and who do youtube videos. \n\nMoney in the music industry has already been trending downward significantly. The only thing AI is going to do, is discourage people who are only in it to make money. The ones who think they can just download FL studio and learn how to make beats in a week and then think they'll be able to sell those beats for $30 a pop, and I promise you those cats aren't making a dime anyways. \n\nThe really talented people are already in secure positions, because they're doing something AI still can't do, which is put on a live performance. Taylor Swift ain't gonna be hurting because Suno can make acoustic guitar tracks with a female vocal. People are into her explicitly because they like taylor swift.",
