    "body": "Someone who can code even a little bit will get orders of magnitude more value out of an LLM than someone who can't. Guess what? Most people can't code. My primary uses have nothing to do with programming, but being able to code lets me leverage LLMs to their full potential. I use webUI's to save money on long context inputs, but for the rest, anything that can be scripted, gets scripted eventually. It's just that I'm still in the phase of setting up and validating complex workflows.\n\nWriting emails with AI is absurd. Sure, it can do that for free, but it's like hiring a PhD to make coffee. Sure, you can assign someone coffee duty, but that's not their real job. Which is why Google's emphasis on using AI to look up yoga classes and email birthday invitatuons is ridiculous.",
