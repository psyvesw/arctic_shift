    "body": "I used GPT on my original text to make it more clear:\n\n---\n\nAs a real-time embedded developer specializing in AIoT devices, my work spans a wide array of technologies\u2014from C bare metal coding to algorithms, neural networks, sensors, PC software ecosystems, and web UIs for system telemetry and control. Here\u2019s how AI has supercharged my productivity:\n\n1. **Diverse Development Languages**: In my role, I frequently switch between coding in C, Python, Angular, and Matlab for the same project. AI is invaluable in translating and replicating software blocks across these different frameworks, enhancing efficiency and consistency.\n\n2. **Optimization at Scale**: My software needs to be highly optimized, often operating on the nano to microsecond scale. AI excels in refining code to meet these stringent performance benchmarks.\n\n3. **Error Reduction**: AI helps prevent mistakes in repetitive and straightforward tasks, ensuring higher accuracy and reliability in my code.\n\n4. **Streamlined Workflow**: Before integrating AI, auxiliary tasks like searching for specific functions or deciding among multiple implementation strategies used to disrupt my workflow significantly. This often led to productivity-killing distractions. Now, AI helps streamline these processes, maintaining a fluid workflow that not only boosts output but also enhances my overall job satisfaction.\n\n5. **Experienced Insights**: As a senior software engineer, I have a clear vision of what I want to achieve and how to do it about 95% of the time. This clarity is crucial when working with AI, as it thrives under precise instruction. Knowing how to deconstruct tasks into manageable chunks for AI and intuitively understanding the viability of its solutions allows me to effectively correct minor errors and refine outputs.\n\nUsing AI in my coding practice has not only doubled my productivity but also transformed the way I approach and execute my projects. It's a game-changer for developers who know how to leverage its capabilities effectively.",
