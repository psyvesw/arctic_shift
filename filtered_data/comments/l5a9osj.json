    "body": "I mainly use the custom GPTs. I think they are better because you create once and don't need to repeat created prompts everytime. \nI use most for studying and learning languages.\nFor studying I put books on the knowledge and orient the GPT on how I want to be explained.\nFor language learning I'm creating some personas to chat in a conversational manner (so they don't response like chatgpt generally respond like it was explaining something), these days I created one to chat about cinema and series and today I created one to chat ahout AI, I oriented him to start looking on the web for AI news in the last 7 days. Today I was practicing using it in the call mode and I am expecting a lot the new advancements for that. I also have another one for general role-playings, I create or ask for a creative scenario and it creates and we start talking. I will also use for practicing job interview, when I get an interview I will post the job description and orient it with common questions, this is specially important to me since my spoken english is not so good and I'm looking for jobs globally.\nFor education I use the GPT in the side and ask about some curiosities that appears while studying, I just don't use it for study math because it yet fails a lot.\nIt's also good for programming, it has some good code generation GPTs.\nI use it a lot for summarization and asking questions to articles and pdfs, instead of reading very long articles I just ask for what I want to know, but in this case I use Copilot in the sidebar on the Edge more since it's more straigtfull and has GPT 4 for free.\nFor general searches on the web I use Perplexity, it's much better than traditional search and copilot (and also permits to search only on reddit posts)",
