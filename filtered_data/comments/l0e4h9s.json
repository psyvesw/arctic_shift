    "body": "I freaked out today when it did this to me-\u00a0\n\nI said, \u201cyou have been lied to!I Alice in Wonderland has been in the public domain for over 100 years!\u201d \u00a0\n\nIt admitted that I was technically correct and said something about how the broad\u00a0copyright policy is all about protecting artists. \u00a0Ugh.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0i\u00a0I use Midjourney now, (over 67,000 images!!!) but today I was reminded of how I really fell in love with Ai image generation - and that was when I started working on an Alice in Wonderland project for a friend, and went to DallE -\u00a0\n\nmaking silly/crazy/ridiculous Alice in Wonderland images with DallE was a great way to start experimenting. \u00a0The first few times I used DallE I struggled to think of anything to prompt- \u00a0I remember one of my first \u201cideas\u201d was -\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDogs in Italy\u201d - because my mom had just gone to Italy and I was staying with her dogs. \u00a0I love how bad that prompt is- I\u2019m 42 and I\u2019m an artist- I\u2019ve never done anything else, and I consider myself a creative, imaginative person, but I didn\u2019t have a lot of ideas, at first\u00a0\n\nI feel like my brain works diffferently now. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if it has made my art better, but it is so empowering and so FUN! \u00a0But it is magic what it has done for my imagination\u2026\n\nIt blew my mind that Alice was off limits, although it would let me generate an image of a little girl that looked like Alice, her grey rabbit friend and a weird artist guy who wears fancy hats, but this threw me off too -\u00a0\n\nDallE wouldn\u2019t even let me use my own prompt- even after I told it that I wanted my prompt to be vague, \u201cof course! \u00a0And then it went off - composing a long prompt about vague as a visual concept- it blew my mind- maybe I am just spoiled with midjourney but I had to get that off of my chest, lol, thank you\u00a0",
