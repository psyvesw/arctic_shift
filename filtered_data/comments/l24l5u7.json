This Is a copy pasta from another post, should help you. \n\nTurnitin explicitly advises not to use its tool against students, stating that it is not reliable enough: \nhttps://help.turnitin.com/ai-writing-detection.htm\n\n\u201cOur AI writing detection model may not always be accurate (it may misidentify both human and AI-generated text) so it should not be used as the sole basis for adverse actions against a student. It takes further scrutiny and human judgment in conjunction with an organization's application of its specific academic policies to determine whether any academic misconduct has occurred.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a warning specifically from OpenAI:\nhttps://help.openai.com/en/articles/8313351-how-can-educators-respond-to-students-presenting-ai-generated-content-as-their-own\n\nThis paper references literally hundreds of studies 100% of which concluded that AI text detection is not accurate:\nA Survey on LLM-Generated Text Detection: Necessity, Methods, and Future Directions\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14724\n\nAnd here are statements from various major American universities on why they won't support or allow the use of any of these \"detector\" tools for academic integrity:\n\nMIT \u2013 AI Detectors Don\u2019t Work. Here\u2019s What to do Instead\nhttps://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/\n\nSyracuse \u2013 Detecting AI Created Content\nhttps://answers.syr.edu/display/blackboard01/Detecting+AI+Created+Content\n\nUC Berkley \u2013 Availability of Turnitin Artificial Intelligence Detection\nhttps://rtl.berkeley.edu/news/availability-turnitin-artificial-intelligence-detection\n\nUCF - Faculty Center - Artificial Intelligence\nhttps://fctl.ucf.edu/technology/artificial-intelligence/\n\nColorado State - Why you can\u2019t find Turnitin\u2019s AI Writing Detection tool\nhttps://tilt.colostate.edu/why-you-cant-find-turnitins-ai-writing-detection-tool/\n\nMissouri \u2013 Detecting Artificial Intelligence (AI) Plagiarism\nhttps://teachingtools.umsystem.edu/support/solutions/articles/11000119557-detecting-artificial-intelligence-ai-plagiarism\n\nNorthwestern \u2013 Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Courses\nhttps://ai.northwestern.edu/education/use-of-generative-artificial-intelligence-in-courses.html\n\nSMU \u2013 Changes to Turnitin AI Detection Tool at SMU\nhttps://blog.smu.edu/itconnect/2023/12/13/discontinue-turnitin-ai-detection-tool/\n\nVanderbilt \u2013 Guidance on AI Detection and Why We\u2019re Disabling Turnitin\u2019s AI Detector\nhttps://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/\n\nYale \u2013 AI Guidance for Teachers\nhttps://poorvucenter.yale.edu/AIguidance\n\nAlabama - Turnitin AI writing detection unavailable\nhttps://cit.ua.edu/known-issue-turnitin-ai-writing-detection-unavailable/\n\nThe MIT and Syracuse statements in particular contain extensive references to supporting research.\n\nAnd of course the most famous examples for false positives:\nBoth the U.S. Constitution and the Old Testament were \u201cdetected\u201d as 100% AI generated.\n\nUsing these unreliable tools to fail students is highly unethical.",
