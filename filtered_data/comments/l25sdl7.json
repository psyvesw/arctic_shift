    "body": "those are all really good and cool points that i didnt know you could do with AI. \n\nAt the same time, why do i get the feeling that AI is almost replacing genuine friendship?\n\n  \nlike with LLM's, i could express my dark humor to an AI and have a fun conversation that i wouldnt otherwise be able to do...\n\n  \n...or i could just find a person that has a dark sense of humor just like me. \n\n  \nwhen you say RVC/TTS to read you a book...well...what about having your mom or dad or special other read you a book? you're still their child...i bet they'd read you one if you asked...\n\n  \nSD/deepfakes, humanizing a pic of a girl/guy on the internet you like...see theres this thing called uniqueness and its present in every single human being in the world. we all have a unqiue face, body, personality, etc. instead of using AI...why not meet people in real life, add them to you social circle and learn to love and appreciate their unqiue traits, flaws and all?\n\n  \nthe ultimate answer, that i think, as to why people are opting for AI over real friends and genuine relationships is pretty much the same answer i get every time i ask my friends and family to hang out and talk with me, me being a retired and VERY lonely schizo at 27 years old:\n\n\"i'm too busy\" is what they say. cant really refute that cuz they do need to earn their keep.\n\n  \nhowever what it seems nobody realizes is these AI that are being produced happen to be made by the same general circle of elites that are also responsible for benefitting off of most of the workforce of the world. \n\n\n\nis that really who you want to give your time and attention to? cuz as the retired schizo that i am, i think you all(the working population) give enough of your time and money to these already very wealthy people already.\n\n  \nI REALLY hope someone read all this and i want to end this essay with a movie reccomendation of the movie \"click\" and this clip from it that speaks to what i wrote here in terms of how i think AI is going to one day impact every society in the world. Family comes first:\n\n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9O-NfAWrkDM&pp=ygUbQ2xpY2sgbW92aWUgZW5kaW5nIGhvc3BpdGFs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9O-NfAWrkDM&pp=ygUbQ2xpY2sgbW92aWUgZW5kaW5nIGhvc3BpdGFs)",
