    "body": "Obviously a dog food company is going to tell you that.\u00a0\n\nDog food has higher levels of bacterial pathogens than human grade raw meat does because of regulations for human food and a lack for regulation of dog food production. This is according to the 2019 study Raw Diets for dogs and cats from the National library of medicine.\u00a0\n\nThe main concern for raw diets were vitamin and mineral deficiencies due to improper foods and quantities.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, to soothe your smooth brain, the intestinal tract length in canine is short in comparison to humans. They also produce 100 times the amount of stomach acid.\n\nSo who is spreading the wrong info again? The government studies, ai, or some Redditor.\u00a0\n\nThe scary thing is the amount of agreement. A foreign country could use bots to upvote only incorrect information thus spreading it like shit on a wall. That is the bigger danger of ai.\u00a0",
