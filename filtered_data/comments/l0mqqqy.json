Everyone involved in this process is passing their work off to AI so we may as well just start selling degrees directly. Fork over a couple tens of thousands of dollars and we'll print off the degree for you immediately and send you on your way.\n\nTo quote Zizek, talking about the growth of the sex toy industry:\n\n> How are we to cope with this brave new world which undermines the basic premises of our intimate life? The ultimate solution would be, of course, to push a vibrator into the Stamina Training Unit, turn them both on and leave all the fun to this ideal couple, with us, the two real human partners, sitting at a nearby table, drinking tea and calmly enjoying the fact that, without great effort, we have fulfilled our duty to enjoy.",
