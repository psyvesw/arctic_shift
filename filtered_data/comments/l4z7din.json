    "body": "I mean, obviously if they interviewed a lot of people and hired someone who sounds similar to Johansson, that's an issue after they specifically were turned down by Johansson. That's a big difference with just hiring someone from the beginning who happened to sound like her without a paper trail.\n\nIt's also different if there is any written evidence they ever told the voice actress to try to sound like Johansson. Which if there is, they're even more stupid than I thought.\n\nThis really all comes down to how stupid OpenAI is, and at the moment, they don't *seem* to be all that smart, what with tweeting \"her,\" and approaching Johansson days before releasing GPT-4o.",
