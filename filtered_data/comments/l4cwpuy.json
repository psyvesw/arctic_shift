    "body": "My fav is definitely the interview prep one. That's the one I said \"Holy shit we're fucked\".. Half joking of course. But \"she\" sounded so genuine, the giggles, the kinda flirty banter lol. I'm kinda surprised they went that direction, but also not. Because they know the market for that is HUGE, it's majorly disruptive tech. Also the happy birthday one. After she's done singing she does the \"blalalalala\" thing and it was so fucking human I couldn't believe it. Like, \"she's\" genuinely funny and personable, I could see myself spending a lot of time with it, girlfriend or not. Like, stick that thing in a sex doll and boom, population decline on a scale we've never seen. Not my thing personally, but there's a LOT of lonely people out there, I don't judge. If it floats your boat, fuckin eh enjoy your perfect, bespoke \"girlfriend\". It's gonna happen sooner than we thought, forsure. Even when ChatGPT came out I thought, in 20 years were gonna have AI robot girlfriends. Now that 20 years seems far too long. Whoever makes affordable robots with this tech inside is going to make billions.",
