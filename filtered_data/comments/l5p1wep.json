    "body": "I think AI will bring a lot of pain in the short term, similar to the great depression. But then we will adapt and there will be new jobs created, just like there always have been after any technological revolution. But I do think we suffer a lot while those jobs and the economic system around them is fleshed out. \n\nThe blue collar work might be here for a bit longer but you can forget about making good money. The money tradesmen make now (rivaling white collar in many cases) is a result of what the white-collar spends on tradesmen. Also, the trades will be flooded. And people will go with the cheapest option as everyone has less money and the supply is way up. The white collar workers will start doing many jobs for themselves as well. Will they frame a house? No, but they can learn to renovate their own kitchen.",
