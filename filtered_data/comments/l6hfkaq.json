There's really no argument against it. \n\nSure different types learn in different ways, but I watched over the course of months as AI agents learned to play Rocket League, going slowly day by day from random, meaningless inputs, to figuring out how to stay upright, then how to move toward the ball, and on and on all through trial and error, until they were able to execute high level game play better than professional humans.\n\nAll through self play, trial and error, tossing out what doesn't work and keeping what does.\n\nThere is no argument one can make that that was not called learning to play.",
