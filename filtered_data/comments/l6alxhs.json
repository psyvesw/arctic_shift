    "body": "On general information retrieval, chatgpt is great for niche knowledge, especially if it's a technical question about a heavily commercialized topic. What I mean is, a lot of the time, if you Google something about, idk, how the quarantine function of an antivirus works, you'll only get affiliate marketing sites and some product pages. But you can also ask chatgpt the same question, get an actual answer, and have it link to sources so you can fact check it yourself. Plus you'll know what to look for now, which is also helpful.\n\nI use it a lot to learn about encryption, since most of the stuff I read is very technical and I need multiple definitions within one sentence. I'm familiar with some of the stuff but not enough to understand it on the first go, but if I get help from chatgpt along the way, I can understand it way better.\n\nSo the tldr is, it won't speed up data retrieval, but it will definitely help you parse topics you don't understand well.",
