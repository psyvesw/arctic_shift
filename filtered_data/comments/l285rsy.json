Frankly, turnitin has always been a pretty shit tool, even before AI. I once got an email from a lecturer saying I had been borderline flagged for plagiarism and yet, I had not even looked at any other content or sources until after I had already written it. Basically I had just written the assignment based entirely on my own thoughts, views, and what I thought to be true. Then I looked up a bunch of research articles that were the slightest bit related to what I had said and there them in as \"references\". I would use the occasional (cited) quote but half the time I would just throw in a citation whenever my argument vaguely connected to one of the studies. Couldn't find anything that actually contained what it claimed to be \"plagiarism\" either.",
