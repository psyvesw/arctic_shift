    "body": "definitely a difference though, llms and transformers dont store everything theyve ever seen. thats how the models are so small. they essentially use a fancy \"neural net\" compression algorithm to store only the most important bits of information about a thing, no different from how you yourself may have seen girl with the pearl earring. you could not create an exact replica unless you had seen girl with the pearl earing thousands of times, but you could recreate it roughly.\n\nseeing a bunch of paintings, learning things about them that make it interesting to you, and then making your own painting by drawing from the paintings youve seen - thats how every human on earth has learned and made things for over a hundred thousand years. theres a reason we dont see cubist paintings in ancient greece, or woodblock minimalist paintings from precolumbian chile. people are not wholly original. they learn from others and deviate only slightly.\n\nai images can steal in the same way a human steals. if instead of asking generic prompts, you prompt it with an artists name or a famous paintings name, then it will attempt to copy it. the same way painting forgeries were made before ai. painting itself is not theft. trying to paint someone elses work directly is theft.\n\nunless learning is a right reserved only for humans. in which case you might want to stop using a computer right now.\n\nwhereas with this sky voice, it isnt a derived voice learned from the synthesized compression of many voices. its just an attempt to impersonate scarjo",
