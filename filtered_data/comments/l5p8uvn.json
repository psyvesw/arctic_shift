    "body": "Please explain what you mean by \"shitting on how the models work.\" Do you think any of them understand the information they're giving you or the fact that they're giving you information in the first place? If so, you're severely uninformed about what they are and what their capabilities are.\n\nThe fact that you automatically reject any take which disagrees with yours is not an insult to me. It just shows your cognitive limitations and lack of critical thinking. \n\nNo one told you that \"it's dumb\" - that's all you could derive from it with your black and white thinking. Of course AI tutors can be helpful, and especially so if they are only trained on a corpus of scholarly information to weed out potential garbage. That's no guarantee they won't hallucinate or fail at unsophisticated math, for example, but they should be more reliable. The problem is that until these problems are fixed, there is a degree of unreliability which makes them risky - and particularly to a novice who can't spot the errors as effectively as a specialist.\n\nI have no idea what \"complaints about its tutoring style\" you're talking about because I didn't bring up any. I told you what a human can provide. This has nothing to do with prompting, but with the inherent limitations of AI. It can mimic certain reactions, it can be encouraging, it's obviously very patient, but it's not yet capable of actually knowing and understanding you. It also has no life experience and has never had any difficulties learning or understanding anything, so all it can do is generate some banal, generic insights. Prompting it for a particular style means you only get what you think you need, while a human being can challenge you in ways you haven't thought about.",
