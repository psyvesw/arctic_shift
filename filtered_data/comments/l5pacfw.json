    "body": "I'm so tired of reading \"AI is going to take everyone's jobs\". AI is groundbreaking - but it's still a piece of junk relative to taking huge amounts of variables that are difficult to gather and interpret (such as driving a car). Why do we need teachers? All you need to do is read the textbook to understand how to do it. If the kids simply read the 300+ page algebra book and do all the example problems (which would honestly take less time than attending class for a year), they would understand it. A tutor takes everything from body language, family context, class context, and merges it to make a super adaptable personalized learning routine and build a relationship. Not a lot of kids will feel inspired or build a relationship/bond with AI.",
