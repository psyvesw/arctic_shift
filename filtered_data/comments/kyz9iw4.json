    "body": "If you look through my Reddit post history you will see that I am supportive and positive and try to be helpful in most of my posts. Which was all I was doing here. I needed ChatGPT earlier to deal with some work bull shit I didn\u2019t want to bother with haha.\n\nMy comment was made in earnest but it\u2019s the internet so perhaps hard to tell how it was meant-sorry. I tried explaining where ai was coming from so that it made sense\u2026.but ChatGPT is down so I couldn\u2019t write it as well as I wanted to! Haha\n\nDef are better than me with AI though. That wound have been awesome to have. I was trying to say I wasted time in a library and having to read countless books and waste hours of my life trying to write papers for college and high school-it sucked which is why I think having ChatGPT must be nice. Nothing about that is better. \n\nI am all for embracing technology and tools. I do not want to be like blockbuster or people that draw lines in the sand with technology.\n\nWork smarter not harder is my favorite philosophy for life. AI rules",
