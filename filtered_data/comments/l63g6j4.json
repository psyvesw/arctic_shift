    "body": "I\u2019m a computer tech, was working on a computer for a college professor and I asked him what he thought about chatGPT. Instantly his face soured and said he\u2019s not a fan and asked me what I use it for. I named off a few basic things but as soon as I mentioned helping me write professional emails much faster than it would take me in my own he said that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t use it. It\u2019s not fair that\u2019s he\u2019s worked 20+ years to develop that skill and now is readily available to anyone and that it\u2019s gonna make him obsolete. I said to him well I may use it to help me with the skill he mastered but he could have easily used it to tell him how to do what I was doing and that it goes both ways. The people that don\u2019t use it and tools like it are the ones that will be obsolete. \n\nPeople are scared and or ignorant to its potential. It\u2019s also has many different uses which still needs some creative thinking on how to use it. In the end it\u2019s a tool and just because anyone can use it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use it better. \n\n-This was my response and this is chats fix for my terrible writing\n\nI\u2019m a computer tech, and while working on a computer for a college professor, I asked him what he thought about ChatGPT. His reaction was negative, and he asked me what I use it for. I mentioned a few things, including how it helps me write professional emails faster. He responded that it\u2019s unfair because he spent 20+ years developing that skill, and now it\u2019s readily available to anyone, potentially making him obsolete.\n\nI told him that while I use ChatGPT to assist with skills he mastered, he could use it to learn what I\u2019m doing. It goes both ways. Those who don\u2019t adapt to using such tools may become obsolete. People are often scared or unaware of its potential. It has many uses, which still require creative thinking. In the end, it\u2019s a tool, and just because anyone can use it doesn\u2019t mean everyone will use it effectively.",
