    "body": "And I just picked plumbers out of a hat.  I don't see AI having a negative effect on anything building/infrastructure related.  Power plants, water purification, power lines, sewers, sewage treatment plants...\n\nIt's mostly middle management and administration that will be effected.  If this moves people from paper pushing to learning practical work, I'm all for it.\n\nI don't think people that work inside buildings and have no idea how they work should be making more than the people that build maintain the infrastructure.\n\nI say we provide food for anyone serious about learning useful, practical skills, so we don't have to do Grapes of Wrath again, but I don't have a lot of tears to cry for administrators and managers that no longer get paid for doing things that we don't need anyone to do.\n\nIt won't be nearly as difficult as last time.  So suck it up.",
