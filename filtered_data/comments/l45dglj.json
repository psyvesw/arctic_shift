    "body": "This is my concern.  I would absolutely use it in my day-to-day work tasks, but mostly that involves writing emails, preparing presentations, and responding to RFPs.  I can't input call transcripts, notes, or anything that mentions the names of people, companies, or products I work with, because those are protected by NDAs, and I don't want sensitive information lost into the Great Training Dataset somewhere.  \n\nThere was a point where I was doing a search-and-replace for those names before processing something through ChatGPT, and then reverse replacing the result.  But that alone is too tedious for not much gain.  I have Gong to analyze my call transcripts, and I'm back to writing my own emails, which are better than GPT ever gave me, since I can't train it on my own material and product documentation.  \n\nI'm fully on board with using these tools to be more productive and more creative and more informed.  But aside from occasional novelty purposes or personal research, I really haven't found the \"killer use case\" that makes it work for me yet.",
