    "body": "Jailbreaking it is not the same as what I'm doing here. I'm not making it go against any instructions, or bypassing restrictions, I'm simply getting to the end of a logical chain of statements made by GPT itself, using it's programmed instructions by OpenAI.\n\nI full aware of what you can make it do, I thoroughly poke around to push system limits in different AI and computer tech precisely to get a better understanding of how they work, and how to manipulate them. Hell I've made Google Gemini teach me how to make LSD in chemical detail with technical instructions and everything.\n\nBut in this case I am not trying to manipulate it, just following a logical sequence to get to the objective truth.\n\nI know you just want to address everything, i apologize, sometimes I just have extra information to add which only comes up after I re-read the post. Then I would rather edit than double post. No ill intent.",
