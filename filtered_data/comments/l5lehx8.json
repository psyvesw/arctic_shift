    "body": "There isn't a single best LLM as they all have their strengths! It really depends on what you're looking for. Some are great for creative writing, while others are better suited for research or code generation. For example, there's a project called HELF AI that caught my eye recently. It's an AI healthcare chatbot specifically designed to help medical professionals and students find resources and answers to their questions. I'm not into the medical field so I can't say how it works but It might be worth checking out if you're looking for new LLMs related to healthcare. I can drop the link below.\n\n  \n[https://forms.gle/3btkC16zXmXVobgA9](https://forms.gle/3btkC16zXmXVobgA9)",
