    "body": "You're missing the point. I was like you earlier today before more details of the case came out.\n\nOpenAI approached Johansson to license her voice. This was their first mistake. She declined. They approached her a second time right before they released GPT-4o. She declined again. Altman tweeted \"her.\" All three of these were royal fuck ups and establish that they intended to imitate her voice.\n\nIf they had just ignored her entirely and hired a voice actress with a similar voice, then it would have likely been fine. But they established a paper trail that proves they intended to make their voice similar to hers, but she declined, and they tried to get around that anyway by hiring a voice actress likely as an impersonator. Legal precedent is that that's illegal. They could have avoided that by just ignoring Johansson from the beginning... but they're idiots, so what can you do?",
