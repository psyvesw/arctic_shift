    "body": "Sorry, it seems that I slightly misunderstood. \n\nI heard Dr. Ravi Pendse, the University of Michigan's Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer, speak on the topic of AI, ChatGPT, U-M GPT, Maizey, etc. just two weeks ago in Taiwan during a panel discussion.   \n  \nSeems that it was just GPT. \n\n>Currently, anyone who uses an OpenAI platform, including ChatGPT, has their information shared with the company. Pendse said building a private platform was a top priority.  \n  \nThe university partnered with Microsoft and its Azure OpenAI Service, building the U-M platform on top of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.0-Turbo and DALLE-3, released by OpenAI.\n\nSource: [University of Michigan to Introduce 2 New AI Assistants This Fall](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/university-of-michigan-to-introduce-two-new-ai-assistants-this-fall/)\n\nThe University of Michigan has released several AI tools for faculty, staff, and students, including U-M GPT, U-M Maizey, and U-M Toolkit.   \n  \nFascinatingly, students rate the answers provided by the University of Michigan's system, called Maizey, which students can use as an AI tutor, as better than answers given by ChatGPT:\n\n>Several classes at U-M are using Maizey AI tutors at the moment. In September, U-M\u2019s Ross School of Business created a project where instructors tested the quality of course answers from Maizey against answers from ChatGPT 4.0.\n\n>Ninety percent of the questions answered by Maizey were rated as better or on par with ChatGPT. Ninety-four percent of\u00a0 Maizey\u2019s answers were rated good or fantastic compared to seventy-four percent for answers by ChatGPT 4.0.\n\nSource: [U-M Maizey AI tool gets new interface, extends no-cost service until 2024](https://michigan.it.umich.edu/news/2023/11/16/u-m-maizey-ai-tool-gets-new-interface-extends-no-cost-service-until-2024/)",
