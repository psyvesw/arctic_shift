    "body": "Now that openAI has a yearly keynote, this is a good moment to release stuff but it's more than 6 months away, it's too far and won't have as much as impact if everyone already does it, except if they release something like that but indistinguishable from reality.\n\nConsidering the small dataset used to train VASA-1 (only 6K example from an openly available dataset called voxceleb2 + 3.5K example that they added to that), on open source version or even a competitor's version (characterAI) could see the light of day far sooner and make their products 10x better.\n\nAnd of course Alibaba has made EMO  [https://humanaigc.github.io/emote-portrait-alive/](https://humanaigc.github.io/emote-portrait-alive/) far before Microsoft Asia made this new speech2face model.  \nSo something like that might be released way sooner than the next openAI keynote",
