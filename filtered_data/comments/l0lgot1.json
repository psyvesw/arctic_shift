    "body": "I have a website full of content that teaches people how to do certain things in my niche, written from my own personal experience. The content I write is my own (written before AIs like ChatGPT were released) and unlike anything on any other website - I got to great lengths to add value and provide NEW content that isn't already found on a gazillion other websites. But when I go to Bing's Copilot and ask it about said topic, the majority of its response is plagiarized from my website - if a human being did that, it would be illegal. It also would not be tolerated at any university, newspaper, etc. because plagiarism has long been forbidden (for good reason!). \n\nAnd I'm not just talking the AI taking 1 or 2 sentences... it takes entire paragraphs of my content using a combination of exact phrasing and swapping out synonyms. That's not okay.\n\nAnd for the record, I'm not anti-AI. These LLMs have huge potential for good. But tech companies should not be using them to plagiarize content.",
