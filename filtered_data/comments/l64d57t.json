    "body": "what competition? is there a competition? i only see people with garanteed jobs that are outside competition on skill, but mostly succeed on a compatible personality, not if they are 10 % faster than that employee with amazing skills but shitty personality.\n\nalways funny seeing those people working their ass off for years in \"highly competitive jobs\" that are now the fones that are taken over by AI.\n\ni make a living by actual labour, i don't see aitake my job over soon, as i have to manipulate various objects for a living, something that ai will not be efficient in for many, many years. also don't have giant study loans for a degree that will be taken over by an AI with the snap of a finger.\n\nseems to me that having a expensive degree and thus a \"competitive advantage\" isn't a thing to rely on in office jobs, is it? ;)  how are americans going to cope? when you posses no skills other than those a LLM could do withing a few seconds, it is going to be a shitty time .\n\ncopywriters, programmers, administration positions, all job examples that will be gone in a few years. seems to me you better start getting experience in manual labour :p",
