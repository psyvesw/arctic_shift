    "body": "Making ANY porn of existing people (especially children) against their consent is illegal.\n\nThe FBI cannot declare \"AI porn of things that are not existing people\" illegal, nor can it proclaim \"porn in general that people cannot tell is an adult\" illegal, as has been determined in precedent.\n\nIn short if someone can make a porno with a exactly one 21 year old human that looks like a 14 year old and dresses in a school uniform banging a 21 year old who looks 40 wearing a teacher costume presented without context, *it follows that someone should be legally able to make that with exactly zero humans at all*. As I recall this describes well enough (though not exactly) a case wherein the actress testified at trial to vindicate the accused by showing her passport with her age on it.\n\nDoesn't matter what the FBI says, and the FBI declaring something illegal doesn't make the FBI right, nor does it make the law itself right even if it did.",
