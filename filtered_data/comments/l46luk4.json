Has been fairly accurate so far\n\nI have used it to provide outlines and schedules for wood working projects at home.\n\nI have used it to write a song about our family dog that was fun for us to enjoy\n\nI have used it for basic research (I know it can be wrong, but it still mostly isn't and I verify what I have do) into things like historic events, materials, and tools\n\nI have used it to find software that I didn't know even existed (\"what tools can be used to accomplish blah blah?\")\n\nAnd I'm sure there is 5000 things I haven't yet thought of.\n\nIt's useful and to everyone without a shadow of doubt. It's just a matter of knowing or not",
