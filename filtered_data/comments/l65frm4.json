    "body": "You can buy most medical equipment from Amazon and other health-tech providers. Even so to the extent that I as a \u201cregular Joe\u201d could essentially buy everything I need to do surgical work. And still have money left over for bills and whatnot.\n\nQuestion is however (Putting aside all of the legal issues with this hypothesis, don\u2019t overthink this Reddit) would I know what the fuck I\u2019m doing? \n\nI mean, who in their right mind would let me do surgical work on them? \n\nYes, the example is a bit \u201cexaggerated\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d. But the point is; access too tool use doesn\u2019t imply access on how to use said tools. \n\nWe haven\u2019t come far to the point that we can simply ask ai: *\u201dHey ChatGPT, please learn quantum mechanics for me\u201d* then upload a bunch of knowledge to my brain or something. And even if we\u2019ve reached that point, capitalism is essentially dead. And our society would encourage collaboration contra competition (**if** and this is a big **if** everyone hade equal access to such technology)",
