    "body": "Anything you need to brainstorm, anything that used to sit on the tip of your tongue, \"what's that Japanese celebration that has big wide hats?\", anything you would google and hope has been asked before so you can find it on a forum.\n\nIt's greatest strength for me is to make short work of anything I need to find an answer for which I can verify the answer if I had it. \"What's the part of a motherboard which connects the memory and something like mos something?\". I'd have a hard time with Google if I couldn't remember exactly what it is I'm trying to find. But if ChatGPT gave me a correct answer, I could google \"what does motherboard transmitter do?\" and quickly verify the info.\n\nAnother one is for getting a framework of written material down. For example, my bio for a new martial arts position. I gave it my experience and what I'm teaching and it returned a bio. I asked it to make the bio more compelling and it did. For someone who may not be articulated, that makes a big difference in their presentation even though it has nothing to do with their ability in the job they're performing.\n\nAnd for anything software related, I use it every day. Being able to take a screenshot of an error instead of describing it in google and hoping someone had a similar one and solved it. JFC, as IT support, that is so huge. For coding, getting a frame down where I can work from and pick apart what each part does is huge. Again, the alternative is Googling what I want and hoping someone else has a situation close enough to it. And if there's a part of their code I don't understand why it's there, good luck. To anyone who would say \"that's how you learn, by searching\", I learn much faster by ChatGPT telling me what the piece of code does.",
