    "body": "I\u2019ve started learning and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found, don\u2019t know if it applies to you\n1) part is mental. As an English speaker I can pick up basic Spanish and French without trying too hard bc my brain applies previous grammar patterns. In machine learning/ai, having previous patterns like oo, mvc etc can slow me down and I run out of memory trying to remember things as \u201cexceptions to previous patterns\u201d. The action is take it slower and learn as it\u2019s own thing\n2) part may be cultural. The more successful prompting seems to be written in \u201dfluent upper middle class hyper-verbal American\u201d for lack of a better term. For example I can imagine a character from the Modern Family sitcom writing excellent prompts. So I will practice, somehow, ways to be more precise and articulate in speech. Saw a thread today asking why so many Americans seem to be great at sales compared with other nationalities\u2026 early training with class presentations? More extroverted and social practice? Raw exposure? This part 2 is still evolving. \u00a0",
