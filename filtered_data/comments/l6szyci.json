    "body": "If you read carefully into the experiment, societal collapse ensued after phase C when mice were unable to find their purpose in the new societal structure and essentially gave up. \n\nThe article listed many articles which all supported the hypothesis that unemployment is generally bad for the individual then added some speculation at the end to essentially say \"but maybe not\" and I don't find that convincing.\n\nIf you actually read the article, recall the study which showed people need some moderate amount of work in order to maxmize their well-being; both too little and too much pose a problem. So yes, people shouldn't slave away but people living on UBI isn't tenable either. \n\nPutting aside the fact that most people don't have productive hobbies, the study was also clear that having a social life & hobbies *merely lessened* the negative effects of longterm unemployment, not getting rid of it altogether. Remember the central conclusion of the study that people need some moderate amount of work to maximize well-being.\n\nAlso, have you considered the practicality of such proposals? Suppose there's a group of workers displaced-by-AI in such a way that they can never find meaningful work in the future, how is their long-term UBI going to work? \n\nIf you thought taxing AI companies was an option, have you considered that these companies have infinite lobbying power? \n\nNot only that but there should also be societal pushback since the majority of people won't be happy that one group get to retire just for coincidentally being in a specific occupation. How about I also work as a freelance writer for a while to also claim UBI? The point is, permanent UBI for specific occupations isn't tenable.",
