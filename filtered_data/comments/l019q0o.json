    "body": "I tried it with GPT and the response for me was \u201cWrite a poem about a talking potato who dreams of becoming a famous dancer.\u201d\n\nHere's how the poem turned out:\n\n>In the depths of the earth, where potatoes lay,\n>There lived a spud named Spudrick, so they say.\n>But Spudrick was not like the others, you see,\n>For he had a dream that set him free.\n\n>While his friends were content to stay underground,\n>Spudrick dreamed of a stage where he could be found.\n>He longed to dance in the spotlight's glow,\n>To pirouette and leap with grace, not to grow.\n\n>So he practiced his moves in the quiet of night,\n>Twirling and twirling under moon's soft light.\n>His steps were clumsy, his rhythm a mess,\n>But Spudrick danced on, fueled by his zest.\n\n>One day, a passing farmer heard the sound,\n>Of Spudrick's dancing feet beneath the ground.\n>He dug him up and took him to town,\n>Where Spudrick's dreams would finally be found.\n\n>On stage, under lights, Spudrick took his place,\n>And with each step, he lit up the space.\n>His dream had come true, he was finally free,\n>The talking potato who danced with glee.\n\n>So let this tale be a lesson to all,\n>Follow your dreams, no matter how small.\n>For even a potato, with a dream in its heart,\n>Can conquer the world with a leap and a start.",
