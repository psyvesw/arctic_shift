Report from the intern, believe it or not, chatgpt. Roadmap for a project, yup, chatgpt.\n\nIt has come to the point that anything new that is writtent, I assume it's chatgpt.\n\nps: obligatory chatgpt embelished version:\n\n> I work with a handful of bright young people who are still in school, doing internships at our company. This observation is backed up by my friends who either have kids or are teachers, or sometimes both.\n\n> No student writes anything themselves anymore. They use ChatGPT for everything. Dissertations? They\u2019re sent to ChatGPT for corrections by their teachers. The other day, I had to write to my insurer, and his response was clearly generated by ChatGPT. Reports from our interns? Believe it or not, ChatGPT. Even the roadmap for a major project was drafted by ChatGPT.\n\n> It's reached the point where I assume that anything new I read was crafted by ChatGPT. It\u2019s like living in a world where originality has taken a backseat, and AI has become the ghostwriter for everything.",
