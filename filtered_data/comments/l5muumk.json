    "body": "\"ai\" is a tool. \n\nThe only people it will replace are people who refuse to learn to use it to become better. \n\nThink about how much faster AutoCAD is than hand plotting. \n\nThese LLMs are just a really nice tool. As they increase people efficiency, the excess time can go to progress.  What I really hope comes from wide spread use of LLM is another tech leap. \n\nAn example from IT, these things are great at writing simple powershell scripts that you might use day to day, but not great at super complex scripts unless you can be VERY specific with inputs. \n\nBut where it can save a TON of time for basically every scripter?  They can comment damn near anything accurately if you supply your code.",
