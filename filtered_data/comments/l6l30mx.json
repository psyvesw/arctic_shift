    "body": "Jokes on you, my manager actually uses elevate, spearhead, and other words I don\u2019t normally see in the corporate world in actual meetings and calls. It doesn\u2019t even sound like he planned ahead either. Just came out of his mouth fluidly. I know this because sometimes I would ask a follow-up question or he had something else to say that someone or I brought up and my man just spits them out. Learned a few vocabs and phrases from him. He sure has a way with words. Other engineers aren\u2019t as verbose as him at speaking, myself included. In academic essays though I used to write like how ChatGPT would write. Nowadays, some professor would call it out if I wrote essays like that lol. How ironic",
