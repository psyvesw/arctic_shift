    "body": ">... it never actually connects Moore\u2019s Law to anything, which, I should add, isn\u2019t so much a law as an observation that has long ceased to be relevant as the shrinkage of transistors has slowed in recent years.\n\nlong ceased to be relevant is a bit of a stretch, since Moore's Law is still maintained... I love the style in which this guy writes, and I can see he did tons of research into Altman and OpenAI but if he's gonna use these types of metaphors to insult them he better do some research into them. If I were to write an article about a CEO not having any substance, not doing any of the actual work, being deceptive, making statements that have nothing behind them, etc., then I'd make damn sure to research every word I write because it's a surefire way of losing credibility. Sure there are some sources that say Moore's Law can't be maintained for much longer but I'd say that doesn't indicate that it's \"long ceased to be relevant\", as the semiconductor industry is racing to keep it alive (and succeeding btw).",
