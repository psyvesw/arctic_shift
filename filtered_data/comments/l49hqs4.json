    "body": "I truly believe most of the world don't know about chat gpt or have barely heard anything about it. I spend a lot of time watching videos and subscribed to youtube channels that talk about anything new tech wise. Anytime I told family members about some interesting new tech to include chat gpt they didn't even know the stuff existed. \n\nAlso, a lot of people are intimidated by new tech and are not willing to research how it works. I feel like people hear ai and feel like even exploring it is way over their heads right away. I'd say us early adapter's are at an advantage. In 5-10 years we will be way ahead of the learning curve and have so many use cases.\n\nI'm super grateful as someone who just loves tech stuff and super curious to be using this early.",
