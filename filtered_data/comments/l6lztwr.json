    "body": "I had a bug in a 700 line file. \nI asked it what was wrong. 6 pages of things to try the most basic of \"turn it off and on again\" crap, after many attempts at getting it to actually answer specifically I gave up and started over.\n\nTried again with. \n\"You have 3 lines to respond\" at the end of the prompt.\n1) You need to call setup dma before starting the adc\n2) this line in the init function is the problem\n3) that should fix it. \n\nI have an entire paragraph of custom instruction telling it not to write code, to have brief answers, it ignores them in a heartbeat.\n\nSometimes saying \"answer the question you were asked\" seems to help too \n\nDid nobody at openai use this before release?",
