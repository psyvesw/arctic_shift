    "body": "I\u2019d look at it more positively. Two of the biggest problems in teaching are:\n\n1. Teachers will never have enough time to help everyone in the class so either over achievers or under achievers tend to get prioritised\n\n2. People learn in different ways and struggle with different topics because of this - there\u2019s no one size fits all but schools are tailored to always teach in one way and teachers have an individual style that won\u2019t suit everyone\n\nChatGPT is potentially groundbreaking here because it can act as a personal teaching assistant for every pupil - explaining concepts in a way that helps those students understand in a way useful to them and that\u2019s before we even consider more specialised uses like for language learning or analysis of problems and text or being a coding aid.\n\nSchools should embrace it in a sensible curated manner and accept it as a tool that kids will end up using one way or another so that it can be used to enhance the experience rather than a thing students try to hide.",
