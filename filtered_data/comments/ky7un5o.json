    "body": "All my knowledge of generative AI comes from working with it and getting deep into the mechanics of it. Pushing it to it's absolute limits. Identifying it's flaws. Using it in completely novel workflows. So no. I'm not repeating any pop sci. If *you've* read some pop-sci that backs up what I've been saying it's probably because unlike you I and whatever you have read is more knowledgeable about this topic than you are. \n\nIt is completely at odds with fine manual control and I'll tell you why. Do you know what the purpose of generative AI is? You don't. It's purpose is to produce imagery with *as little knowledge and input from the user as possible*, it's purpose is to offload the creative process from the user who is assumed to be artistically incapable. This is the exact opposite task to following extremely detailed instruction.  \n\nIt is what a player piano is to a pianist. The goal is to not have the player do anything. \n\nYou're attempting to give off an air of knowledgeability on this subject but you've said precisely nothing that would actually imply you have any.",
