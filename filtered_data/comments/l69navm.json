    "body": "The other day a colleague of mine wrote an angry email about how things are not progressing with his team. As soon as we saw it, we were 100% sure ChatGPT or other AI tool wrote it. As far as the tone of the email goes, he was angry. But, we didn\u2019t get his emotion. All seriousness was lost and we started laughing at the email. \n\nSo recently I was given a PoC + Presentation to complete in a week. As soon as I got it, I knew ChatGPT was the perfect candidate for help. But, my creative spirit is going to be crushed, I won\u2019t research or analyze the topic myself. CharGPT is going to limit what I can research myself. It\u2019s going to be a good starting point, but never end to end.",
