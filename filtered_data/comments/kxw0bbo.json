    "body": "I hate to break it to you, but the \"AI art is theft\" stance is not one that can hold up in court, and is, let's just say a minority opinion. You're not going to get very far with that. \n\nAnd, as I said is my previous response to you, this is coming from someone who's business was killed by AI. I'm 100% sure that my previous writing was in the training set for the AI that ultimately killled my freelance writing business. \n\nYet... I can move my feelings aside and tell you that it's still not theft. Processing and ingesting is not theft. Models are million-fold more transformative than the kind of transformations that were OK'd by the Supreme Court over 100 years ago. \n\nYour arguments will most likely fail in any court. The AI is here to stay, and it's only going to get better. I shouldn't even be bothering with you because I need to be adapting to the future. So should you. \n\nI have sympathy, but that doesn't change the facts. \n\nI'm going to block you now, because you seem to be talking more out of FEELINGS than reasonably taking in what you're being told and trying to learn about how best to face your own future.",
