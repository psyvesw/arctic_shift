    "body": "However much your struggles with anxiety make life difficult for you, trust me, you don\u2019t want to have what I have. What I have hurt my relationships, friendships, and my career, all because of my trauma created a bunch of side effects that include an appearance of bliss and not giving a fuck. \n\nI appear to be blissful and calm not because of reaching a level zen but because of just being tired of all the mental anguish of having CPTSD.\n\nLook at it from my point of view though. My day to day is stressful as fuck. I simply don\u2019t have the time to deal with the additional bullshit that society hands us, whether it be fascism, global warming, or some paper clip optimization machine. \n\n\n\u2026And you know what, suppose this \u201cAI\u201d takes over and performs some Genghis Khan level atrocities that folk like you and I can\u2019t deal with. It will still have the problem of traveling through space and making it outside of the solar system. \n\nAnd if that\u2019s not a big enough problem, it will have to deal with intergalactic space travel and the really big problem of entropy.\n\nSo in that sense I\u2019m not really worried at all.",
