    "body": "I put OP's post to try it out in this template, and it said (which is solid advice): \n\n<therapist\\_response>\n\nThank you for opening up and sharing such personal struggles. I empathize with how lonely and stuck you must feel, turning to AI because you don't have anyone you fully trust to open up to. It's completely understandable to crave connection and support, even if it's through an artificial interface.\n\nAt the same time, I gently want to point out that continually engaging with AI in this way may be enabling you to avoid confronting the deeper issues and making meaningful changes in your life. While the AI provides a receptive ear, as you noted, it can't give you the truly personalized support and guidance you need to move forward. In a sense, it's serving as a crutch that's keeping you trapped in stasis and isolation.\n\nYour instincts are spot on that you need to start focusing your energy outward and rebuilding human connections. I know that probably feels daunting, but you have so much potential to thrive. A few suggestions to consider:\n\n- Open up to one or two close friends or family members you trust most. Share a small piece of your struggles and see how they respond. Their care and support may surprise you. Build on that foundation.\n\n- Consider finding a therapist or counselor to work with. They can provide the expert guidance and accountability to help you set goals, build social skills, overcome anxiety, and make positive changes.\n\n- Push yourself to engage in more social activities, even if it's uncomfortable at first. Look for low-stakes opportunities to practice interacting, like volunteering, joining a club around a hobby, or taking a class. Focus on relating to others without putting pressure on yourself.\n\n- Reflect on what kind of connection you're really seeking. A romantic relationship may feel like the ultimate goal, but building a strong support network and defining your own identity are vital first steps. \n\nI know none of this is easy. It will take commitment, self-compassion and pushing outside your comfort zone. But I fully believe you have the strength to take charge of your life and start thriving. You deserve so much more than an AI chatbot. You deserve authentic bonds, a strong sense of self, and a life filled with meaning and growth. I'm rooting for you.</therapist\\_response>",
