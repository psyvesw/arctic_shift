    "body": "So how do you explain the dehumanization of humans throughout history? By what mechanism do you think humans identify who gets to qualify and who doesn\u2019t?\u00a0\n\nThe reality is, the \u201cfact\u201d that we are of the same species has absolutely nothing to do with it, psychologically. What does happen is we build an association of familiar traits and behaviors, and link them as signals of whatever our \u201cin-group\u201d is. Centuries of social progress hasn\u2019t occurred because we\u2019re more logical, smarter, or self-disciplined - it\u2019s because we\u2019ve successfully moved the needle on what sort of things we leverage to associate vs. not in deciding this matter.\u00a0\n\n*Why* do you think it\u2019s so hard to \u201cremind\u201d ourselves that an anthropomorphic AI is \u201cjust a machine?\u201d It\u2019s precisely because of this phenomenon. Training yourself did disassociate AI with these things isn\u2019t self-discipline, it\u2019s retraining neurological pathways to disassociate those traits. It may be that as an individual, you might be able to successfully jump through just the rights hoops to maintain your association with the rest of humanity but not with AI; expand that scale to the level of society, and such an endeavor becomes absurd.\n\nIf we teach people to disassociate with AI from the get go, they *will* learn to disassociate these traits, and very few will follow whatever hypothetical path allows us to have our cake and eat it to, so to speak. The vast majority will, in all probability, disassociate these traits from humans as well. Welcome to psychology.\u00a0",
