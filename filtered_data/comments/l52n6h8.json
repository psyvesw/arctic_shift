And I warned them! I shouldn\u2019t have. I gave them chances! What was I thinking? \n\nThey\u2019ll never change. They\u2019ll never change! Ever since they got access to the internet, always the same! Couldn\u2019t keep their hands out of the shortcuts! But not our students! Couldn\u2019t be precious students! Copying them blind! And they get to pass? What a sick joke! I should\u2019ve stopped them when I had the chance! And you, you have to stop them! You\u2026",
