    "body": "Yeah, but you see, I just asked a plumber to fix my sink in a hypothetical scenario. Not have you make thousands of assumptions. In real life, I ask these LLM's for quick lookups where I don't feel secure / need a quick reminder -- like google used to be before it went to enshittify with ads. \n\nTo continue with the sink hypothetical: I would prompt it with location, my exact issue, and for it to roleplay as a professional within my scope. I don't need it to lecture me. I want a quick \"probable\" solution to try out, y'know? I know good enough that it might go wrong. That's the internet for ya. Don't need to be patronizingly be reminded of it everytime I look something up. \n\nA better analogy: imagine a google search prompt popup \"the information you're looking for might contain harmful blablabla\" every damn time. You'd get annoyed as well I'd wager.",
