    "body": "Music, art and movies soon will soon be severely devalued, since it won't require specialist training, tools or especially much time to create it.  There will be a deluge of content so huge that nothing in particular will have any monetary value anymore.  Entire industries will be wiped out almost over night by this. \n\nLive music might have been the last refuge for musicians, but when an entire generation grows up listening to AI generated music, then live music won't even be of interest to them.  The dwindling appeal of live music can already be seen in the lack of interest in music education in schools.\n\nSimilarly for a generation growing up viewing primarily AI generated art and movies, they will \\*not even care\\* about that last refuge of hope for artists, that being human creativity.\n\nPost-scarcity society will be a very very rough ride.",
