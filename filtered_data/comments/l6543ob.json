    "body": "Exactly, most people I meet still don\u2019t have the wherewithal to look something up consistently on Google, they are perfectly happy to shrug their shoulders and just admit they don\u2019t know something and let someone else find out. It\u2019s maddening to me.\n\nI\u2019ve shown people how fantastic LLMs can be, I know perhaps a couple of people IRL that use them very occasionally. Currently, just like Google, the use of AI tools is seen as a \u201ctechnical\u201d or complex activity that you need to \u201cunderstand\u201d before you use. The main issue is not that people don\u2019t know these tools are there, they just can\u2019t fathom how to engage with them or when. I\u2019m reminded of a time years ago I had to teach a new engineer how to use Google, they just didn\u2019t get it, which mind blowing but once they understood they could be autonomous in finding their own answers they were away and improved massively at their job.\n\nIf they make the process of engaging with AI more natural and they present the average person with a killer use case then obviously more people will adopt it\u2019s use on a larger scale, but until then I feel it will remain primarily a benefit to those with the desire and curiosity to use it.",
