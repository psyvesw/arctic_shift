    "body": "Are you talking AI humanoids or AI on your phones? Either way, like I asked another person, in all seriousness tell me how because I am open to learning new things so I can better understand the risks. Send me links to research papers or articles from leaders in the field, otherwise it's just dystopian story telling. \n\nI can tell you that AI will give us a future that will make science and medical advances that will improve the lives of people all over the world. It may eliminate the layers and layers of administrative staff that may actually help fund universal healthcare in the US. AI humanoids could provide mental health benefits to low income people at a fraction of the cost, or companionship for the elderly. Help people with loneliness to build esteem and learn to interact better in society. Assist people who are not able to leave their homes easily, and etc.\n\nThe biggest dystopian threat AI will have is on the job market. What do we do with the displaced workers, and how does this effect our economy locally and globally? This is the more realistic threat imo than Big Bad infiltrating the system to control through emotional manipulation bc people have an emotional connection to their AI. If I'm misguided, in all sincerity, please educate me.",
