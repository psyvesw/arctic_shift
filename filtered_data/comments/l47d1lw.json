    "body": "Yeah I can confirm this.  I've had ChatGPT-4 give me straight usable advice/code for using a particular engine but ChatGPT-4o assumed things that didn't exist, called functions that aren't there and messed up how certain features of the engine actually worked (in terms of hierarchy, it just assumed it worked like other engines).  \n\nWhile ChatGPT-4 also fails at times correcting it once gets it back on track (e.g explaining the nuance of how an engine handles something usually rectifies it's logic when writing code).  ChatGPT-4o will repeat the same instructions (literally) even after explaining why those instructions don't work (\"I'm really sorry for the frustration my previous responses, let's write the script for this feature:\" spits out the exact same thing it was corrected on; yes that was a copy-pasted reply, showing how poor sentence structure really is)\n\nAsking it anything non-code related also gets you the most superficial entry-level Wikipedia answer in the world.  Even if you ask it something very specific and nuanced (e.g. Jupiter's Great Red Spot and thermal composition will give you a Wikipedias entry page as a reply; more prodding will finally make it look at the paper associated with the question but even then answers are superficial with zero expansion).",
