At this point they won't be able to keep their hands off you. \n\nNurture dependence - make all those high-schoolers need your product to write a paper. Maybe you hype the threat that your product will eliminate humanity. You're not going to do it, but the implication is there, and it means they need you for protection. \n\nNeglect emotionally - release an updated product that doesn't work as well, maybe leave the board for a week. Maybe some ai destruction of society article comes out, and you're not there to give everyone a sense of stability \n\nInspire Hope - stage a triumphant return, do some press tours and let them know you are back, and maybe let's some skynet conspiracies slip so they know you're needed\n\nSeparate entirely - stage an IPO to sell out all your shares at the peak and ride off into the sunset after having created nothing meaningful and maybe buy an island or two.",
