    "body": "Idk, most ai images can pass at a short glance, but given more than a couple seconds and they all have this \u201cuncanny valley\u201d thing going on.\n\nYou know something isn\u2019t right, despite not knowing exactly what it is yet.\n\nAi has a pretty hard time with what\u2019s in front of another or behind, and merging two non distinguishable points on objects together.\n\nSomethings don\u2019t have a definable end so it\u2019ll just sort of turn into whatever\u2019s closest and become something different.\n\nAlso very close together straight line patterns like air vents and sticks and whatnot where there\u2019s a lot of densely packed straight lines, it\u2019ll also struggle with.\n\nThe view of different windows will also have different perspectives that don\u2019t line up with the view of other windows, or background tables and other items.\n\nThe people in the background will normally look disfigured or unnatural, compared to the people in the main shot.\n\nThe fingers and hands of course, and also some clothes will blend into other pieces, or it\u2019ll become apart of someone else\u2019s clothes.\n\nThere\u2019s also the walls will have details that don\u2019t follow from one side to the other behind characters or people. \n\nAlso the walls don\u2019t make logical since like where it should go down to the floor to finish the door trim, it instead becomes the corner despite not being the actual corner.\n\nReally, if it isn\u2019t immediately within the focus of the image it doesn\u2019t get the detail that you\u2019d see in a normal image.",
