    "body": "I think everyone expects it to be like C3-P0 and are like \"It's not a perfect stand in for human thinking\".  Dude.. it doesn't have to be THAT good to still do what I need, and probably better in most cases.   We don't need a full on person to replace a person doing a job.  Just something that can do the job.  \n\nWatching it speed up my coding, having it help me learn a new engine, or just rubber duck something with more feedback... and that's my fun stuff.  I've used it to generate first draft company documents, create a good job description for a position I was hiring, etc. \n\nWere there edits to be made?  for sure.  Less than if I did it myself?  Also for sure.  Did it have it done in 30 seconds in stead of a week?  yep.\n\nAI will get better, and even as is it could still blow things apart.  We're in late 90s internet era.  Yeah, it's cool, but it hasn't reached it's full potential yet.",
