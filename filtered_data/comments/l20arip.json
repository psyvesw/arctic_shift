    "body": "For research, you may have better luck with [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/).  ChatGPT is good at engaging on imaginative tasks, like brainstorming character motivations.  I have a very long chat with it where I've boiled down things into two competing metaphorical beings, and it's occasionally surprisingly insightful.\n\nThe other big strength/edge ChatGPT still has on the competition is prompt writing for image generation.  The image generation built into ChatGPT is fine, but there are better models.  However, you can get it to generate an image, then click on it, click on the (i), and copy the prompt that it wrote to generate the image.\n\nPut that image prompt into something like [Ideogram](https://ideogram.ai/) and it'll usually give you something much nicer than if you're crafting an Ideogram prompt from scratch.\n\nYou can also upload PDFs or Images and have it summarize, analyze, give feedback.  If there's a comic you're working on (and you're not worried about OpenAI ganking it), you could share and ask for specific feedback.  \n\nChatGPT can also write and run Python, which is super helpful if you need a bit of higher mathematical reasoning for something.  I find its web integration pretty crap, still... most RAG systems are bad right now, though, so not really ChatGPT's fault.\n\nThere are now individual better options for everything ChatGPT does, but ChatGPT still has the most variety of functionality in one place.  So umm, hope that helps!",
