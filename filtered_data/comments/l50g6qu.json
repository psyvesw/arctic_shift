    "body": "I sent you that readme because it's openly available and easily digestible, of course the physical code that Microsoft use in their closed proprietary environments will be slightly different, but this is the same principle on which the memory features of copilot are based. It's not magic. There's plenty more documentation available if you're willing to read it. \n\n\"then why are you acting like im making this up?\"\n\nBecause your original post and subsequent followups WERE made up. Your post strongly implied that this odd behavior was unsolicited, but we quickly learned that you explicitly asked it to behave weirdly and it was infact acting completely predictably. \n\nI am not rejecting in the slightest that you can get AI to say weird things if you want it to, or even that will do it of it's own accord sometimes. What I am rejecting is the suggestion that this post is insightful or even informative. In fact it was straight up misleading.\n\nCan \\*you\\* even sum up for me what point you are trying to make? The only useable message I can take away from this is that the adage \"garbage in, garbage out\" applies as equally to LLMs as it does most other things.",
