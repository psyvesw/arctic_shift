    "body": "> No joke you go over in r/teachers and you\u2019ll see horror stories of teachers and school workers having to break up legit sex acts or kids watching hardcore porn in class just from proliferation of smart phones, 90% of parents already don\u2019t give a shit, and even if you do and set up protections for your kid, they\u2019re just going to go to school or a friend\u2019s house whose parents dont give a shit and they\u2019ll still be exposed.\n\nI am a teacher myself and I feel like schools share blame here. For so long everything tech related had been ousted from classrooms. Nobody educates kids on the responsible use of the internet and phones. They never get digital ed analogous to sex ed. Ask r/teachers about use of AI. They will jump you because they are so against it.",
