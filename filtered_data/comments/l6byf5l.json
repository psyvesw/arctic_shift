    "body": "If you are a parent or coach using CGPT for planning, teaching, or more intentional coaching, please let me know what worked well for you. I have a slightly advanced 6 year old but I'm interested in all age groups.\n\nI use it for parenting needs, it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. \n\nFor a while, I was using it to generate 4 minute bedtime stories with certain themes and names that my daughter asked for, which it was great for. Then I used it a lot to condense and tease out research or theory from parenting or child development books and asked ChatGPT to design child dev activities for my child's specific needs. It worked okay for this and let me know where to deepen my research and what to skip.\n\nHowever, when it comes to creating academic plans or reading materials, it was not good at all. For example, I would ask it to create a reading progression plan for 9 weeks of summer, so that we go from one reading level to another one with certain amount of time spent on each reading level. It could not do it well no matter how many corrections I pointed out.\n\n It also can't create good reading passages for new readers without inserting words they are not ready for, even after I defined it, but [ProjectRead.ai](http://ProjectRead.ai) does a great job with that and it's significantly easier to use, so I use that for reading content  instead.",
