    "body": "Cases like this can hinge on the instructions the voice actor was given, along with any company emails from OpenAI's side and of course any social media posts, the last of which there already are in the public domain...\n\nThat fucking post was so stupid, because any lawyer with half a brain will tell them that guilty or not, Altman just poisoned any potential jury against himself and OpenAI with that post. It makes it look like he wanted it, then there's the fact he repeatedly was refused - Altman's already publicly written most of the narrative for the other side's lawyers and the case isn't even filed yet...\n\nHis lawyers told him to pull the voice and do it quickly, as soon as this blew up and the exposure became apparent.",
