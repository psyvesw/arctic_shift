    "body": "I was talking about investors, not companies. OpenAI may want to do  as much AI as they can, but if they can't find an investor to give them money, they won't. And I was talking about future investors and companies, not about current investors and companies.\n\nAnd of course it has happened. Just ask the nuclear industry how easy it is for them to find investors these days. Just ask the Google Glass guys how easy it is to get investors for augmented wearables these days.\n\nAlso, your question is already wrong: \"despite the potential for immense profits\" is the part that investors will not believe anymore when the catastrophic failure has happened.",
