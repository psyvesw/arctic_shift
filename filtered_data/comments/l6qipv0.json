    "body": "Oh for gods sake, someone like you with immense musical talent can take a tool like this and you will beat the fucking pants off any of us jack asses with no real knowledge of music. This won't replace you anymore than the phonograph did. Every generation of modern musicians has to go through this. Whether it was the record player, the electric guitar, whatever. Assuming a future wherein there are no musicians who don't use an ai model, games that use a real musician will likely beat out a game which uses only the ai output, all other things about the two titles considered equal. \n\nGive Beethoven an ai model and I bet you he would do things we cannot even imagine. True genius, like that of say Michelangelo, who picked his own stone, will learn to not just use these tools, but *create* these tools. Welcome to the future where language is still the most powerful tool around, just except now a days it's programming languages, where function calls have replaced rhetorical chicanery.  \n\nThe power of this stuff lays in artists using it in their process where the human connection and soul is retained. I don't see it ever replacing artists outright, but it's impossible to tell the future other than I think it will head where the cycle of necessity and convenience takes us. It will always be necessary to have convenient access to music, and part of that will be the necessity of making music production convenient.",
