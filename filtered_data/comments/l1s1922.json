    "body": "I use it for recipes and recipe iteration.  I use it for dnd prep, to generate npcs, pictures, items, etc.  I use it to help learn languages.  And many other random things, mostly ro help explain concepts and flesh out my understanding of ideas I don't care to or don't have time to deep dive on.  \n\nJ still use it because it works well, they keep adding useful new features, and to a small degree because I now have nearly a year's worth of content I've generated and can use. \n\nI did try Claude the other day and it seemed quite good, but I do feel that each engine has a prompt style, and I feel comfortable with Chatgpt.  Although that is probably biased.  I do pay for it.  \n\nChanges I would like to see include a more conversational style option, less restrictive content rules surrounding potentially sensitive subjects, and basically any ability to provide sources.   It's insane to me that they don't have to provide any kind if credit or source in any way.  \n\nI would not use AI art or writing in a professional product such as publishing a game or cookbook.",
