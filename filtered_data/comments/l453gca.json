You were probably one of the first kids to understand how the computers worked in the library when you were in school. You probably had access to the internet before a lot of others. Society needs you.\n\nYou make conversations like this happen:\n\n\"Oh yeah, I heard Lisa's boyfriend talking about some artificial intelligence thing. Is that what this is?\"\n\nWithout you, people get scared of new tech. They need someone they trust like you to talk about it. \n\nDon't be dejected. Keep doing what you're doing!",
