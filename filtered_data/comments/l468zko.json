    "body": "\"Her\" is not dystopian. It shows a possible technology and explores how it affects humans and human relationships. It is neutral in this regard, but of course viewers can develop their own feelings towards it, so some might see it as dystopian.\n\nThe movie is brillant, I loved it from the first minute I saw it ten years ago. I\u2018d never though at that time that something like this would be remotely possible within my lifetime, yet here we are.\n\nI have the feeling that this wonderful piece of fiction inspired a lot of people in tech, as it is often the case with the best literature of its time. A wonderful story.\n\nThe question remains how people will deal with the latest tech of OpenAI. There will be problems. But there are chances as well. There are so many people in the world, and many are just old, who feel very lonely, and have no chance to change that. Maybe a whole lot of people will be relieved. And knowing of the therapeutic capabilities of LLMs, who knows, maybe they can even help people to get better, build up confidence and enhance their lives.\n\nThat\u2019s my hope.",
