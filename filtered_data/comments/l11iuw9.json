    "body": "AI isn't mainstream yet. Heavy emphasis on the \"yet\" part.\u00a0\n\n\nRight now businesses are using AI to reconfigure their entire business models and workflows because those have the most immediate payoff. There's nothing super new to construct, no leap of imagination.\n\n\nIt's that leap of imagination that will be required to make that first killer AI powered app. I think the lowest hanging fruit there is gaming. Fully functional and rounded NPCs will make games way more immersive or in open world systems allow players to go waaaaay outside the original parameters creating their own side quests and stories.\n\n\nI strongly believe children will start getting AI tutors in the very near future. I remember seeing the Khan Academy AI demo about a year ago and was very impressed, and it was built in GPT3, which seems antiquated already.\n\n\nI don't think there is going to be one massive AH HA moment, but a steady stream of incremental steps. I was a teen when AOL launched and everyone started getting online. AI is already growing waaaaay faster then that, but the pattern is very similar.\u00a0",
