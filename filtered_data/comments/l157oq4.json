I used the subtitle transcript from a Zoom call, and even though the transcript had LOTS of errors in it, the GPT summary did not (which sometimes blew my mind). Of course proper nouns were often missed, I had to fix that manually, but that\u2019s was pretty much it.\n\nIt would also format the minutes as bullet points, or an outline, or as prose. And if it was too wordy, I could just say \u201cshorten it,\u201d and bang, it\u2019s done.\n\nAt the bottom, I always put \u201cNotes prepared by LEGODamashii with assistance from ChatGPT.\u201d",
