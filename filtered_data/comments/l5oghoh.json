    "body": "The wealthy won't need the poor or working class in the relatively near future once AI is fully established. That's why they so openly and boldly push the LGBTQ Agenda. It's easier and cheaper to get humans to self-destruct and self-eliminate by making heterosexual relationships go away than it is to eliminate us through wars. Wars are messy and affect even the wealthy. Culling the population naturally by bringing down the birthrate through the promotion of homosexuality (and feminism), whereby women are being convinced that motherhood is not worth the effort is easier, strategic and more humane. The wealthy wish to be in a place where there are less humans to deal with, except for the very few that would initially be needed to help maintain their AI bots, while allowing them to live in peace and tranquility with little to no demands or distractions from poor, needy humans. Slavery and serfdom were similar models, but look how that turned out! This time around, the wealthy are more prepared and are determined to have much tighter controls of their strategy!",
