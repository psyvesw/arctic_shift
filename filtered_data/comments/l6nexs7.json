    "body": "Of course, many jobs will be displaced, but how does that get to \"I will not be employed in 3 years\"?   She's arguing \"ending employment as we know it\" in 3 years time in the top line.\n\n>\u00a0Is it that you do not believe that AI will improve sufficiently to displace workers, or that his timeline is off? And if his timeline is off, is it off by a factor of two, 10, or 100? Where do you think artificial intelligence will be in 15 or 20 years?\n\nThe article is more nuanced; it's just the intro that's off.  I don't expect massive end of employment (as opposed to pressure to get a new job) anytime soon.  It's extremely difficult to forecast, but I think [metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8480/us-labor-force-participation-rate-below-10/)' 25% chance by 2059  (35 years from now) is probably reasonable - realistically long after I'm dead.\n\nI don't think ASI is credible until well in the 2030s and even then, humans will still have comparative advantage in all sorts of knowledge work (because the electricity guzzling AI with limited roll-out cannot solve all problems).\n\n>I\u2019m in my early 30s. I plan to work another three decades before retirement. How much will AI change that?\n\nYes, I agree AI is likely to have an impact on you, more so if you are in knowledge work.",
