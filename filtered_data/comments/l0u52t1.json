    "body": "Once Ai bots get propper hardware implementation within the upcoming years yes, her job is toast just like everyone elses. The phones didn't have any cameras at first, you have to specifically take a camera with you and then over a course of few years every phone had one and now we have so much bad digital photo junk to drown in daily. Now imagine if we had an ai that could always be available to snap the best photo with all those cameras. Imagine every camera click ever done soon will be on a professional level. \n\nIf she loves to create/take photos she will do it out of passion as a hobby cause she likes the process of it and its rewarding to her mentally/spiritually. \n\nBut do not be fooled into thinking 99% of all jobs and since you specifically asked photographers wont be replaced by digital or mechanical driven ai.\n\nHuman labor is over, start thinking of hobbies.",
