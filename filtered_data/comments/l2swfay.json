    "body": "Well if you're smart, then think about your argument. There are literally more humans that don't actively go around killing animals etc, and yet somehow a lot of them still go extinct from collective human behaviour.\u00a0\n\n\nThe reason why that happens, which I'm sure someone as smart as yourself already knows, is misalignment. Because you're so very smart, you also probably know that alignment research is an ongoing and unsolved problem being worked on by the top AI researchers.\n\n\nSo when you say defender AIs, you are presupposing that alignment has been solved and that we can convince a superintelligence to do what we want it to do indefinitely.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, alignment hasn't been solved, and it doesn't look like we're on a path to solving it before superintelligence. Maybe the likes of Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua B, the whole superalignment team at openai, etc, are all wrong about this. But you, oh wise one, you are correct! Guide us. Lisan Al Gaib!\u00a0",
