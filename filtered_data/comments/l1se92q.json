    "body": "I don't know how to use or access any of those, or know why I would. ChatGPT 3.5 has been useful enough for the limited set of tasks I have it do. It's a slightly dumb and vaguely autistic but well educated enthusiastic study buddy, and I've always wanted one of those.\n\nUntil you mentioned them in this post, I didn't even know Gemini or Claude existed. And doesn't Llama require me to have a $4000 hobbyist-tier supercomputer just to train and run? I don't want the hassle of that, I already have a ChatGPT account through my Google account.\n\nI go to the bookmark, type in what I want, and it runs correctly 90% of the time because I know how to give clear instructions and I don't ask for too much. ChatGPT is already good enough - same way Gmail or YouTube is already good enough for my purposes.",
