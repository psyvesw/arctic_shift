    "body": "No. An AI Chatbot cannot remember a student's learning habits and patterns. However, it can communicate and pretend to understand what we are saying. And answer in a way that seems to be better at generating factual information, without actually understanding that information.   \nThis is the issue of people not understanding Large Language Models. As long as no one has trained an AI specifically on pedagogic methods and trained it on teaching and the long-term results of the taught content and methods, there is no AI chatbot that intrinsically understands what the needs of that student is.   \nJust because people are buying this app doesn't mean they actually work.",
