It doesn't have typos either. \n\n* The fact that you like what you wrote more than you like what it wrote doesn't mean you're a better writer, it means you're biased towards what you write. I'm the same way--I always like what I wrote better, but I recognize that that's an opinion, not an objective fact.",
