    "body": "ChatGPT has changed my life in how I learn things.\n\nI learn by asking dumb questions. The questions are not dumb, but they are 3-4 tangents removed from what I actually want to know. So to another person, it can very challenging answering my questions in a way that\u2019s useful to me. Basically, there\u2019s always this cartilage between me and the other person helping me. This cartilage metaphor is a skill I developed over time that smooths out the transactions of communication and the transference of knowledge. It\u2019s\u2026 cumbersome having to repackage how I think every time I want to have complex and technical/rigorous dialogue with another person.\n\nChatGPT is the first time I have ever felt empowered and proud of my intelligence because it\u2019s as if I can just let my brain be my brain. ChatGPT is the perfect proverbial \u201cmental Tennis\u201d partner. No matter how I serve the ball. ChatGPT always serves it back.",
