    "body": "Although I had to make minor adjustments, over 90% of the codebase was generated via ChatGPT. You can try it yourself by visiting [gpt-dashboard.com](http://gpt-dashboard.com/).  \n  \nWith this website, users can create a personalized dashboard with analytics derived from the provided data. Users can delve into details such as activity usage, entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and classification of chats. Based on these analytics, users can construct a digital persona. I developed a custom GPT model to generate user profiles based on their aggregated data.  \n  \nThe application is client-side, which means that all computation is performed on the user's machine; in fact, the user can disconnect from the internet after the initial load and still be able to analyze the data. The only information collected concerns errors and whether data has been provided. The website also works on mobile devices, but due to computational complexity, the more cores your CPU has, the quicker the website will analyze your data.  \n  \nThe results are remarkable, from a 50 MB file, I was able to deduce my profession, location, and hobbies and even generate an image of myself. This project highlighted the importance of our data and how large companies can more effectively profile us to target advertising or sales. We are living in a digital age where every online activity is tracked and analyzed.  \n  \nThis research reminded me of an intriguing documentary I saw a few years ago, released in 2013, titled \"The Value of Your Personal Data.\" Over a decade ago, companies could predict if someone was pregnant based on their shopping habits\u2014imagine the tools they now have to create a detailed personal profile based solely on analyzing the traffic you generate online.  \n  \nI also produced a tutorial video on how to use the website, with both the script and narration generated. Now, we can modulate voices with a markup language, and soon it might be difficult to distinguish real voices from synthetic ones.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-3ykFEIz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG-3ykFEIz8)",
