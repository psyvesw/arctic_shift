    "body": "> You also vastly underestimate how god awful the average student essay is in a gen ed. \n\nYou vastly underestimate how awful the average trouble ticket or developer request is for IT people. It's still my job to interact with it-- often for tens of hours a week.\n\nLets be real, bad essays can be parsed and responded to in minutes. You don't have to check spelling / grammar to spot weak arguments, bad thesis, and poor conclusions.\n\nAs I say-- our AP lit teacher would give us the 30 minutes before lunch on many days to craft 2-page single-spaced essays. I imagine she read through them in about 2 minutes, and I imagine many minor issues got missed-- but it does not take very long to grasp the argument and find the critical flaws. And I credit that experience with crushing the AP exam, and being able to write professionally (post-mortems, plans-of-action). \n\nI'm not suggesting the job of a teacher is easy or that there aren't challenges here, but what I'm hearing is *\"it's tedious, I'm lazy, and most students don't care so I'm not going to assign essays\"*. And if that's the mentality I'm hard pressed as to why an AI couldn't do the job of a teacher. Their job is to challenge students and teach them to think critically, and if someone finds that too hard then maybe they're in the wrong field.",
