It seems to me that just about any manual and deterministic or predictable process is something that software can be programmed to do. \n\nWhat is an example of something \u201cimpossible\u201d that you\u2019ve asked GPT to code? If it\u2019s not something as abstract and subjective as \u201cwhat are X\u2019s exact thoughts and feelings\u201d, I would figure that it probably *is* something possible to program, but perhaps our current GPT is not quite good enough to figure out how to code it given its current understandings of programming languages and coding paradigms",
