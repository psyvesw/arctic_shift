    "body": "Nope. I have been begging our academic integrity people or the faculty senate to develop policies regarding its use. Other universities around us have done so or at least made it explicit they are in a pilot testing phase. But for some reason, my university just gives very vague guidance. \n\nAnd our composition faculty have tried to take a lead on this, but they don't really understand the technology. We had the head of AI ethics from a large tech company come to a panel discussion, and the comp department chair (a person who can barely operate their desktop computer) talked over the real expert the entire time. The tech related faculty are not being listened to and have largely given up to focus on their own research and classes. \n\nFor me personally, I had conversations with students who scored high on AI. Basically, I tell them I'm not taking off for this because I don't know what this number really means, but I want you to be aware that what you are doing it setting it off. 9 times out of 10, they say they edited with grammarly (which I have explicitly said is okay for them to use as long as it is for grammar checking).",
