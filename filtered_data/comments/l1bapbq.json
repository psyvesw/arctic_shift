    "body": "What's that conclusion? Sounds irrational. I ask it to give me an output, it gives me the output with the word, I way to not use that word, even said to substitute it with another one, and it does so for a few outputs then forgets the command. Didn't did it before this memory update. Maybe the tool is bad with understanding negatives, I don't know, but sounds weird, I'll have to research about it more to try to understand what you mean, but sounds weird or not applicable considering my case. I have a computer science mayor, doing a masters, I think I understand a bit of programming and how to properly give it a very specific command, and I think thousands if not millions of people are relying on it for income, so that sounds dumb too. Worked well before update, doesn't work well now. All my scheduled work for today is drastically delayed because of it because I was expecting it to work as it has been working these past days, something that could cause me to lose money. Not saying anything else, just a simple proposal to change something simple as to allow users to know about all updates beforehand so they can plan around them, and/or allow them to update ChatGPT at their own time, to reduce the chances of it breaking and causing business delays which could cause some losses because of the expectation of the tool working as it has been. Don't get why you're passing blame to me rather than reading what I'm saying, which is a case with an issue, and a proposal to solve it.",
