    "body": "I think that's an interesting observation but I think it's still very different. The issue with GPT-4 or Claude 3's models isn't that the model is incapable of taking in visual data, it's that it's incapable of reasoning about the data to produce reliably correct outputs. I think it'd be fair to test an LLM that wasn't multimodal against a blind person though.\n\nI think if you flip it around the other way, if you had a person who was capable of seeing but incapable of counting the number of cats in a picture, it'd be a pretty fair assessment that they're significantly below average intelligence. If the bar for AGI is to broadly meet the reasoning abilities of a typical person at arbitrary tasks, they'd be well below it with such poor visual reasoning.",
