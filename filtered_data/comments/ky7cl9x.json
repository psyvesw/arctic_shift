    "body": "So while its true that not many employees of chat gpt are reading your chats, that's not the whole truth.   \n  \nAI Trainers from other companies are being hired out to train AI like Chat GPT and all the others. You didn't hear this from me, but they do read your actual conversations. Like hundreds of employees. They are not told where they come from. They are just being given the data sets. So someone at Chat GPT is reading chats and selecting conversations to be graded. Even the inappropriate role playing one's, the one's with person information, and the one's with deeply concerning questions. They read them all. They train on real data. Now of course the sensitive one's get flagged and thrown out, but they do still read them. Which means a normal person, again not coming from me, is reading what you write. \n\nThis is why AI chat bots have a warning saying you should never give an AI your personal information. If you think the AI trains itself, your wrong. People train the AI by feeding it chosen pieces of data (aka your conversation).\n\nPlease don't ask anything else, because I can't say more. That's all. You've been warned.",
