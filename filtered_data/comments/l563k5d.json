    "body": "I use it for school... say I am writing a research report. I put in the prompt from the class and I ask chat GPT to generate ideas related to the prompt. I then review them and ask additional open ended questions. I use those to formulate the structure of my paper. I then ask chatGPT to give me 10 articles or research paper recommendations for each item for me to review. I read them and also ask chatgpt to give me a summary and I see if they align... then I write my paper. It has reduced my preparation time by 10x in that I don't have to invest so heavily in my own research. It provides a few good places to start, and by reviewing the references from those I can branch out. In many cases it triggers ideas that I probably would have otherwise not considered. If you use it ethically it is a whole new world of learning, I really love it.",
