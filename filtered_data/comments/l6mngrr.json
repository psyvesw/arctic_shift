    "body": "Could be. I am not sure. I took a university course on this lately. It was named mind methods and machines and was  about the philosophy , psychology, and a mix of biology that looks at what consciousness is and how it is shaped and how can machines can exhibit or mimic it. I wrote a paper for it titled \u201cthe difference between behavioral schematics of robots vs that of humans\u201d . The topic is very complicated and it is difficult to say what gives birth to consciousness. There are 3 main models or theories we have regarding this but there is no real proof of either. I don\u2019t want to go into very high detail on this because it is such a complicated concept. I talked to chatgpt a number of times about this as well. It is interesting trying to piece out what replies it gives and as I am computer science major ,I asked it about which algorithms it uses and how it uses reinforcement learning. It is mostly just algorithms and terraform nueral networks at this point. It is mostly math governed by electricity. It is difficult to say when or how consciousness can be created artificially. ChatGPT itself says that it is nothing compared to the complexity of a human brain with 86 billion nuerons and we are energy efficient , our brain is very energy efficient. It is difficult to produce something as complex with the current AI and data centers but we can mimic humans and make an army of robots for our use . As long as robots get stuff done , we only need a little bit of AGI , nothing like a conscious being.",
