    "body": "Sure it does. But compared to the general population it's not widely used. \n\nMy wife is not into tech. She just uses it where it makes sense. Phone. Tv streaming. Alexa or Google for simple questions, or to control the deck lights. \n\nShe hears me talk about AI all the time. She might ask some questions about it but has no urge to use it. It doesn't serve a purpose for her. \n\nMy kids are pretty tech savvy (ages 11 and 14) but aren't that interested in it but found some useful ways to use it. My daughter scans in school notes to summarize them when studying. \n\nBut to the average person it's just some new thing that they keep hearing about. \n\nIt's all going to change but this is just the beginning.",
