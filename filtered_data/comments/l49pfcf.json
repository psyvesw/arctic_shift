    "body": "Think of it as all the knowledge humanity has in a new form. You could go to library before internet to learn anything, then you could google, now it's in highly customiseable conversational experience form.\n\nYou can ask and have conversation on any subject. It can help with any task. Dunno you want to travel somewhere - it will give bunch of suggestion what you could do there based on what interest you.\n\nWant to learn a language it can help, you can have conversations in any language.\n\nConsidering what movie to watch - it can suggest.\n\nI mean the possibilities are literally endless. Easiest is to go to chatgpt (it's free) tell it about yourself (or write in custom instruction in settings) and ask it how it could be helpful for you personally.",
