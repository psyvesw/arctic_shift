    "body": "I'm not saying OP is right.  There' s place for translation tools like what OpenAI has shown.  But, LLMs are not replacing the need to learn a language when you live somewhere that speaks a different language.\n\nBut Google Translate is very literal and not good in most situations. For it being literal, imagine you want to say in Italian, \"She's a good girl!\" about a dog.  Well, they don't say that.  Google will give you a literal translation that is technically correct, but it will be a very odd thing to say to an Italian.\n\nThe problem is really context.  It doesn't know if \"you\" is singular or plural.  It doesn't know the gender or age of the person you are talking to.  Or the social context, like how well you know the person or a person who is working vs a casual encounter. \n\nI've found ChatGPT to be a great augmentation to my language learning.  I can ask it language questions the instant I think of them.  Or right after I encounter a situation I wasn't prepared for.  Give it some context and run through some scenarios.  Language is at the heart of a LLM.",
