    "body": "I retired not that long ago, and I have now created my own \"Fact-Checking Assistant GPT\" focused on taking on the role of an expert in any given field of expertise, and made it only use knowledge from known experts and highly reliable sources. It will still hallucinate at times, but a lot less than it used to.\n\nI use it to dive into fields I've wanted to learn more about for years, and now I have the time to do so.\n\nIt ranges from geopolitics, EV-propagation worldwide, to US politics, to some linguistic studies, searching the roots of different words. ChatGPT can write in old Norse, old Greek, old Hebrew, and show me the linguistic history of words. I don't understand old Greek or Hebrew, but I understand enough old Norse to make sense of it. Who knew it could do that with such skill...\n\nAlso legal stuff. When SCOTUS makes a ruling, I use ChatGPT to take on the role as a legal scholar specialised in the constitution and it does a remarkable job.\n\nAlso uploading the EIU Democracy index 2023 and have a chat with ChatGPT about it. Great!",
