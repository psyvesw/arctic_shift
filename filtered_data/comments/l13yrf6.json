    "body": "1. 95% of the time the Custom GPT returns landscape images and the basic almost always returns squares so I'm comparing first tries to first tries. \n\n2. Some of my \"basic\" pictures may seem better than a brand new Copilot account which is because of account migration there isn't much I can do about that I'm not buying a device just for test images. The basic \"19\" is an example of this it's a little advanced--the prompt should have been too vague and it has elements that can make the viewer dizzy if they stare at it too long, I should have used a different example.\n\nThe pumpkin patch image is another example that would probably be much worse on a basic new account and this is due to creating the images in succession between basic and custom. \n\n3. I have not even uploaded data to the GPT yet so it's not even close to done and I can't share the link in it's current state until I know it's safe to use (it's currently not).\n\n4. The instructions I'm giving are mostly coding based having to do with AI axis of rotation, temperature, and orbital delineation. I can't give out these instructions and you would need to learn the coding language for me to even help you write your own.\n\n5. Instead of trying to carefully define what Dolly (DALLE-3) does, I let her do whatever she wants and focus on defining restraints instead.",
