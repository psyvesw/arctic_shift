    "body": "I personally believe anything can be healed, but that's also coming from my own personal spiritual beliefs in alignment with psychology. I think it would involve a process that would include connection with the self, humanizing children, abstaining from objectification in as many ways as possible, finding hobbies to have better coping mechanisms and ways to identify as a more enriched human being. Basically a lot of reconditioning. \n\nIt's a big question to be honest, and there really should be more studies. I think the first step is allowing pedophiles to get the help they need rather than waiting until they hurt a child and punishing them. I don't care how much of the tax payers money goes to the programs, as long as they are logical and focus on psychological aspects of shifting the pedophiles mindset. Money should be no obstacle when it comes to preventing children from getting hurt. \n\nCSAM should be taken far more seriously. It is all over the Internet at this point, which is horrifying. That's why the idea of AI CP being legal is a nightmare in my eyes. We also need to have better restrictions on the sexual content children have access to and just better sex education in general. Having had conversations with pedophiles, in addition to reading accounts, I've seen a lot of them talk about how they have a history of sexual trauma and/or very early exposure to porn. This is a big piece to the puzzle, though I do believe it is more complicated than that. \n\nI wish I had all the answers. The world is a dangerous place for children, now more than ever, but we have to start somewhere.",
