    "body": "I don\u2019t see how I disagreed with you. I simply said that the AI sitting on a shelf in the cloud isn\u2019t what\u2019s going to be transformative. ChatGPT isn\u2019t going to replace Susan in HR per se. It\u2019s going to be Natasha in Ukraine who uses ChatGPT with her own custom API to recruit and interview the first round of candidates for a job at XYZ who\u2019s going to be the one doing the replacing. I agree completely it\u2019s not a 1:1, I\u2019m just saying it isn\u2019t the technology that\u2019s doing it\u2014it\u2019s people who use the technology to their advantage\u2014which, by the way, is always the case when there\u2019s a new tool that becomes available to everyone all at once. Those who leverage it benefit the most, and those who don\u2019t are inevitably forced to adapt or change or lose out. Chimney sweeps in the industrial era suddenly replaced by an electric furnace. They learn a new trade or they fall behind, and ideally they learned a new trade that benefited from the new technology (HVAC repair vs. chimney sweeping).\n\nObviously there was a century in between chimneys and HVAC that gave people time to adapt and learn and for new industry to grow. I don\u2019t think it will be that long this time. Maybe 7-10 years. At most probably 12.",
