    "body": "From a biological point of view, ChatGPT is only the language areas of the brain combined (Broca and Wernicke). It lacks purpose and goals (frontal cortex) and self-reflection (associative areas).\n\nA human brain could be described as a bunch of small GPT models with distinct functions. The first functions that evolutively appear are areas destined for homeostasis (temperature, O2 saturation, glucose / electrolyte levels), followed by areas of self-preservation (limbic system, fight/flight response).  On top of that consciousness appears very late in the game.\n\nFor your AI companion you are going to need some drives (I need to learn, I need to grow, I need to be useful) and some negative feedback systems that allow it to stop (I'm tired, this subject is boring, I want something new/I want to go home). \n\nYou could use all these data to create an automated prompt for it, that is eventually presented in a GPT format: \"Your name is (NAME), you are an autonomous AI assistant for (USER), your current status is (STATUS), your current mood is (MOOD) and you want to (WANTS/NEEDS), what do you want to do now?\"\n\nWhen your model reaches a conclusion, then actions can be performed, and update its current status. That's very basically how a brain works.\n\nAnd this is how you begin to get autonomous agents.",
