    "body": "Dude. Ok, I will explain the situation to you:\n\nThere is a movie called \"Her\". The whole movie you would hear Scarletts voice and she acts like an AI Agent/Assistant. They tried to get her voice for this emotional bond, we created over the years with this utopia described in \"Her\". She declined. It's not just a simple voice that sounds similar. It's the whole concept they stole and manipulated you with. They could get a completely different voice or even a male one, but they didn't. They did want to push the \"Her\" narrative. \n\nIf they were allowed to do that, that would create a REAL presidency for cooperations to steal everything, even concepts and ideas that others created. It's not just using her voice for training. Scarlett does this to safe her IP, she does this of course for her own benefit, but she accidentally creates a defense for ordinary people, who won't have billions and a team of lawyers. \n\nHow can't you see this?",
