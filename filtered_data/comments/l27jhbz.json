    "body": "I lecture digital marketing. We had 106 students in two groups. This was not a double blind test or anything, we just wanted to get a first idea because the question came up a few times and there was no evidence pro or contra to be found. Results were not supposed to be published. Call it a decent experiment, not a real scientific survey. \nI\u2019m not going to explain the whole case here, just the results.\nWe had each student ask chatGPT 4 enterprise for help in writing a fictitious master thesis in 16 iterations with a preset structure. We reviewed the results after 8 and after 16 iterations. \nSummary: there was a big difference. The polite group came up with much more measured results. And even though it shouldn\u2019t matter, LLM\u2019s are programmed to guide towards constructive conversation. By agreeing to that, the LLM didn\u2019t have to lose time in guiding back towards civil conversation. Which resulted in a considerable time (3 iterations less needed on 16) saving. \nVery interesting to do!",
