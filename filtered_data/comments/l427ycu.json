    "body": "I agree.   \n  \nI actually work in IT industry. As many programmers know, \"naming things is one of the most challenging things in programming\u201d. And I'm not trying to be funny or sarcastic. IT really is, and can have wide implications further down in line for development of your product or for other programmers to understand the intent of your code. \n\nFor example, if you never read an article about ChatGPT models: Which one came out later - ChatGPT 4 Turbo or ChatGPT 4o ? Which one more advanced? That's why we use semantic versioning, or date based versioning, to taking guessing out of it, and words like \u201cbasic, standard, pro, etc\u201d: To simplify and explain things quickly. \n\nPerhaps the most famous and apt example \u2014 If you consider Windows XP , Windows 2000, Windows ME , Windows 7, 8.1, 10 and 11? Only towards the end of the array, you are starting to guess that 11 came out a few years after 7, but how do you know which one is \u201cmore advanced\u201d or which one is newer \"XP or 2000\" ( without diving into research head first?) \n\nMy point this problem has been around for a while, and not a new issue - people in charging of Marketing and Development at OpenAI - should know better.",
