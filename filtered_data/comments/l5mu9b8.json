    "body": "I am wondering whether different people are receiving different versions (and functions) of this so-called 4o model.  My \"Pro\" subscription 4o model can NOT replicate any of the long form text on image using the exact same Prompt used by OpenAi on it's website showcasing what this new 4o model is supposed to do.  Instead it creates an image with total gibberish text, not matching the number of lines, verses and I'm lucky if it's able to output even 2 or 3 correctly spelled words (whereas on OpenAi's website they show it accurately Outputting 14 lines of elegant hand written text divided into 3 verses, 4 lines per verse.  \n\nThen I ask it to tell me how many lines of text are in the image that it has just Output.  I is unable to analyze the image and provide correct number of lines, first it says 21, the 19, then 23, etc. ... but the correct number is 17.  I then ask it to type out 'gibberish' illegible lines of the Output text image and place numbers next to each line, beginning with the number 1.  It can only count to 9, then it puts \"0\" instead of 10, then it repeats numbers from \"1\" ... so it is never able to arrive at the correct number of lines, although this task should be elementary grade school Math that any 7 year old can accurately perform.",
