    "body": "When Microsoft word was invented, the entire typewriting industry collapsed and everyone who refused to evolve with the technology was left behind. It\u2019s not the technology that takes over industry, it\u2019s people who know how to effectively use the technology that take over. The pipeline for solving solutions at my company include my boss telling me some problem, me asking chatGPT for help with coding a solution, and analyzing and tweaking what it spit out. Of course my boss could do that, but that\u2019s like hiring a calculator to do an accountants job, you still have to know how to effectively use the technology given to you.",
