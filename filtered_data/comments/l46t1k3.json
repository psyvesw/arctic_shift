    "body": "Dang! That's a lot! . . . But if I'm being honest . . .\n\n1. Most web browsers can do the same no? \n\n1.5. this may change with the update, but hasn't a chunk of the answers recently been wrong/misinformation? I would rather go through every source on my own research than have to try and figure out which one website the Chat accidentally got wrong info from (I will use this as 1.5 in future concerns)\n\n2. That's awesome, but I'm really not that creative, I can appreciate the world's others have made but me personally I have no use for this as I often struggle with words and descriptions \n\n3. What's different from that from Google? (And 1.5)\n\n4. Maybe, I'll have to try that for learning a new language, would it do auditory translations? Otherwise I'm probably going to mispronounce the word when I try to say it lol. But for translating Google translate has been amazing as of late (from an AI? Even so it's still runs like Google so I wouldn't consider it quite like chat GPT) so I don't see a big need for that. \n\n5. That sounds interesting! I'll have to see what it can do about making lists, but even then what's different from me making an event in my calendar?\n\n6. Honestly I'm not taking very much health advice from the web/ (1.5)\n\n7. I feel like most well adjusted adult humans should have a handle on this. From friends, family, co-workers, or whatever social network they use (like reddit for me at times) especially since entertainment and hobbies is usually enjoyed more with other humans \n\n8. Again haven't used it that much, but from my fairly basic life I don't have much technical support that I wasn't taught, or wasn't able to Google. Although programming and web development is definitely out of my sphere of influence, but I also don't see the average person doing that stuff \n\n9. (1.5) Yaaaaaaaaa I'm not letting a public resource advice me how to use my money, espresso one that isn't 99.9% accurate \n\n10. Again this is something I can ask family, friends, or Google about where I would still get equal to or better results. \n\n11. Like you said not a substitute for professional help, but I feel like if you have good friends then you may not need a majority of that, and what's left I still feel like a quick Google search would be able to get me the same answers. \n\n12. I think that's something that could be overcome with experience and friends ( although I am almost certainly gonna ask and see what it says still lol)\n\n\nWhile I do agree it is a very versatile tool, but at this moment for the average person I just don't see the draw. For very specialized things / subjects it can be amazing! But it feels like for the most part for everyday people it's about equivalent to an Alexa",
