    "body": "First off, current AI isn't intelligent, not even close. It can't think new thoughts, it can just execute them and make connections, generally without any ability to prioritize. Second, we aren't even close to an AI that can actually think. All they can do is take vast amounts of information and perform a specialized form of correlation to produce human-like responses. \n\nFinally, AI doesn't have hands and feet. It can't build things. Maybe robots can be controlled by one, but after many decades of development, we still can't get one to stock shelves or fix a car. Now imagine trying to program one to go into a house, diagnose a plumbing problem, find the easiest way to pull apart the house causing the least damage, fix the problem, recommend a future course of action, and put everything back together.",
