    "body": "I am a teacher trying to implement LLMs and AI in certain areas. Everyone agrees we are overworked and do not have enough time in the day to get everything done that is asked of us. I will be using an App to give my students feedback on their written stories. Because it is grade school the LLM can easily give good feedback (it checks for repetitions, use of certain phrases and adjectives, descriptions of feelings...stuff like that). The Apps feedback is more detailed, quicker and honestly better quality than mine. The only thing it does not do yet is take into account a students learning level. I use the feedback the students receive to talk to each student about their stories and feedback. I can only do this because these AI tools have allowed me to automate certain phases of my classes. I feel no shame in using them",
