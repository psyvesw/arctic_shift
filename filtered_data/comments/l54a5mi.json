    "body": "It already does.  After some research and planning, while listening to binaural beats to induce delta waves, I had ChatGPT do a QHHT hypnosis induction and therapy session on me this evening. After coaxing it to slow way down and to pause to wait after each step, until I was ready for the next step. it helped me discover underlying beliefs causing me current challenges. I remembered a time from a different lifetime like a movie. It guided me and asked me to describe what I see and about my thoughts. l made sure to dig for my underlying beliefs that support my problems. I cried three separate times after ChatGPT made insightful connections based the symbolic ideas I described.  When I was ready, I asked it to guide me back to fully awake. And it did.  I feel more at peace and present. I know why I did some behaviors. Time will tell if my issues are resolved. \n\n$20/mo is a bargain if you are creative with it.",
