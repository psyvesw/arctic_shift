    "body": "I'm not saying advancements like this won't significantly cut into the language learning market. But speaking a second language is so fundamentally about the vulnerability and humility that comes from stepping into another person's world, another person's language, and communicating with them on their terms. It's one of the ultimate signs of respect and honor. Yes, you can have a machine do it for you, but you'll be making that communication about you and your terms.\n\nTo be clear, I think there are tons of use cases where this tech will be enormously transformative and valuable. But it certainly won't kill the desire to actually learn another language. If anything, the ease of AI translation will only make unassisted conversations between people of differing first languages all the more valued and respectful. \n\nAI is going to make anything digital cheap and disposable. Digital music, art, film -- it's all going to get lost in a upcoming sea of AI bullshit. But the people who can genuinely paint on canvas, play with a band on stage, have a real conversation unassisted by tech -- this is where the real currency will lie in the future.",
