    "body": "No, I get it.. I feel ya. I think about this kind of thing often. Everything is going to SaaS,PaaS,IaaS, everything will eventually be a subscription and AI will be baked into all of it. I am a bedroom music producer. I use a digital audio workstation called Ableton Live and a bunch of other software to make music and we all know how things are going in area of the circus. I have no doubt that generative AI will be able to make high-quality \"bangers\" (that people will actually listen to) on it's own with no human feedback, eventually. But I still want to make music. I'm not going to stop. \n\nI see where things are going so I have a license of Windows 10. I own all my licenses to all the locally installed software on my audio rig and have every option/feature installed so that everything can be run offline forever. One day all of this will go away. You won't be able to buy it and you won't be able to do any of it online. It'll all be different. But I'll still have an old-school setup that doesn't have to be connected to any platform. I don't need subs. I don't need anything except except for what I've got in that box right now.",
