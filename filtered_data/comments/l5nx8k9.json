    "body": "How much do you think UBI will even be? \n\nI know countless Canadian families with $600,000 houses, 2 vehicle payments. If they lose their jobs, should they lose their houses? Because they will.\n\nThis whole thing is going to happen fucking fast. Too fast for meaningful policy discussion. Run the numbers on what real, job replacement, for the masses, UBI is going to look like. It's not something that I ever see happening (ie: every single person getting 3000-5000/month for the rest of their life, that will grow with inflation).\n\nFurther question for you to chew on. If we see 40% unemployment, what is UBI in your world? Is it unemployment insurance, paid out to the people laid off, or true UBI where everyone gets it? How much should UBI be? Should it depend on the City of the receiver (ie: rural mid-west vs tech hub city)? Should their costs be taken into consideration? \n\nIf everyone did get, for instance, 4000 a month or something, what does this rapidly do to inflation, rental markets, etc as the 50-60% still working get massive surplus of free spending money, and the unemployed, replaced by AI class barely afford to survive. These are the honest discussions of the next decade. No politician is touching these deep issues with a 10' pole. It will be everyone for themself, with bare minimum, \"thoughts and prayers\" for the families who lose their homes, the ones who are in a perpetual state of retraining for a new career only to lose that 2-5 years in and start again, we'll see massive poverty growth on a scale never before seen in the west.",
