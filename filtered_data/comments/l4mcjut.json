    "body": "At this point I have to tell I am somewhat disappointed and mildly irritated by this release. Of course they are amazing and of course GPT-4o kicks ass but (!!!) it was released in a major hurry. They could have taken a week or two and release the actually working and functional product with, at the very least, most of the features. Now, I understand this has to do with Google and they wanted to be first. This explains everything but in the end that's not much better than what Google does: they announce things and sell them before they are ready, while Google announces things and never actually bothers to fulfill them.\n\nAll it would take was to make clear indications and timelines when certain features will be available, a line of text in ChatGPT online and in mobile apps saying that \"New voice mode is coming soon!\" or \"Amazing new features are coming soon!\" and everyone would be happy. Now I find that custom GPTs, and this was confirmed by their support, although it is self-evident, use older GPT-4 model. Images are generated through Dall-e rather than being a product of a multimodal GPT-4o, new voice is unavailable until god-knows-when, same with video, same with copy-paste shortcut for macOS ChatGPT app or live capture in that app. 3D modeling? Guess what, no, not available because Dall-e still. I mean, at the very least the company this grandiose could spend 10 minutes with their own products to create a clear and precise announcement. Instead we keep fortune telling and trying to look for hints. This isn't a game, this is a product and it does cost money. Sorry, I just really am somewhat annoyed.",
