    "body": "okay\u2026 here\u2019s where I\u2019m at. I don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve worked with too many companies claiming their shitty AI can do anything and everything. from Security promises to hacking stuff. \n\nso I could redo that experiment of gkamradt and fork his repo to publish my findings. which would be really cool and compelling (\ud83d\ude09). \n\nbut if I\u2019m honest with you I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll test X\u2019s claims and then study them. it\u2019ll take me till monday especially because I don\u2019t have an environment hanging around I can use for gkamradt\u2019s docker environment, so that\u2019ll take a minute or two.\n\nso this is a \u201cfaith\u201d experiment in my book. how much faith do I have in X not stretching their claims or testing in weird ways that make them look better. in short none. even if this was google or OpenAI I wouldn\u2019t believe it because companies lie and even why they\u2019re telling the truth it\u2019s not the exact truth. \n\nyou can believe X, but you and I will just not figure this out I guess.",
