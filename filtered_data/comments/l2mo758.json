    "body": "Yeah, this can be done, but LLMs are not good at math. However, the Advanced Data Analysis tool that is part of ChatGPT is better, as it uses Python. You will need ChatGPT 4. 3.5 cannot do this task well.\n\nWhat I would to is say something like:\n\nI have a some bills/receipts that need to be categorized with those categories being summed up. (Clear Instruction with desired end result)\n\nHere are the categories (or if you do not know, ask it to give a suggested list of categories).\n\n-Category 1\n-Category 2\n-etc\n\nI will give you a bill at a time then you take the items from it and put each of them in the correct category. Keep track of the total in each category as we go. (This will help the model keep the correct totals in it's context and minimize it just making totals up.)\n\nPlease make sure that you use the Python tool (what ChatGPT internally understands Advanced Data Analysis to be) to make sure that the math is correct.\n\n----\n\nAlternatively, you could just have ChatGPT do the part where it adds the items to the applicable columns, output it as a csv file (it will do that for you and give you a link to click that will download the file), then open the file in Excel and add the totals there.",
