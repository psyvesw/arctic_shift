    "body": "Like Facebook, Google became big on a great idea and a great product (google), had some solid secondary products (gmail, chrome, android) that were popular, some solid secondary products that were not popular (voice, domains, scholar, fonts, classroom), quite a few that were good ideas poorly implements (google+, gchat), and then a lot of \"we're desperately trying to keep relevant and keep up but please go back to our solid products and have you tried voice\" moments. Gemini is hovering between the \"keep up\" and \"unpopular secondary.\" Without a better overhaul of the chatbot, the chatbot will die. The MODELS, however, are quite good and will probably find their ways into a hundred different things on the back end, much like a Mistral or a DRBX or command-r. Very good models, but the customer facing UI (the chatbot) is not as exciting as ChatGPT which has everything.\n\n  \nI think a lot of AI companies should stop trying to catch up with ChatGPT for popular use - that will be its downfall, the assumption that the chatbot is the AI - and really work their butts off on tearing through some of the obvious use cases that baffle the general public. Why can't it do math? Why is spelling so hard? I swear, if a chatbot could count, spell, and do math, that would end GPT tomorrow - oh and verify its infomation. Reka just makes shit up right and left. Someone get her to stop (10 fake quotes from the Wizard of Oz today when I asked for one real one).\n\nWow. More words than I meant that to be. Um. TLDR: I agree. Google often screws itself with poor follow-through and management of seemingly simple tasks. But we're all obsessed with chatbots when the back end models are very good regardless of the popular response.",
