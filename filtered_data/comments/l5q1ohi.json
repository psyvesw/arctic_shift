    "body": "Yeah I thought it was an interesting idea also \n\nJust occurred to me last night as I'm eagerly reading book 3 of the discworld books.\n\nWorks have been continued by other authors in the past. The Wheel of Time comes to mind for me. Robert Jordan died before the 14th or 15th final book in his epic series. Brandon Sanderson was chosen to finish the story.\n\nThis would be similar except an AI would kind of personify they original author rather than have another author do it.\n\nOf course it could be an awful thing. Perpetual monetisation of the dead. But if the author wanted their work to continue I'd be fine with it",
