    "body": "This is so true. I needed to learn SwiftUI, one of the languages for building iOS apps. I took the official Apple tutorial but that just teaches the \"how\" not the \"why\". \n\nSo I took snippets of the code from the tutorial and kept asking ChatGPT to explain the syntax. I wouldn't move on until I fully understood each bit of code from the tutorial.\n\nEven better, as I was getting better at it, I'd switch roles and explain the code back to GPT and it would tell me what I got right or wrong. \n\nI've never felt closer to Neo learning kung-fu in the Matrix. It wasn't just giving information, it was that it did so in a way that fit my brain so well. At the start of each chat I told it what coding languages i already knew and it frequently related the new concepts to the old.",
