    "body": "There are chat gpt plug-ins that are linked to thousands of credible research sites. It's honestly crazy what you can learn through the app. I always recommend double checking information before accepting it as a fact, however my personal experience so far has been nothing short of awe inspiring. \n\nIt's allowed me to increase my productivity in numerous different ways and I've used ai to build crm platforms that increase my productivity even more. \n\nI'd say before chat gpt I was capable, with chat gpt I've been practically unstoppable. \n\nI generate more business, provide better results, my time management skills and my data collection have been far beyond previous versions of my work.\n\nIt's phenomenal. If you haven't taken anytime to just play with it you should. \n\nBut with ai you have to teach it the way you need the information so learning about proper prompting, and data generation is super important.",
