    "body": "First and foremost: more.\n\nThe first task I used it for was grading my papers before submission so I could use the feedback immediately rather than after we got teh paper back.\n\nThen I started using it for job searching. It took some doing to get it to spit out quality resumes but it's doing it, and the cover letters are excellent. Already at this point I was reaching daily limits.\n\nI started using it to generate posters to advertise products at my store.\n\nI used the therapy bot to help me deal with my speech impediment and it was surprisingly helpful.\n\nVoice transcription is something I'm having a blast with (most tools don't work because of my speech impediment).\n\nVarious things can be difficult to research because of the wrong words. So I'll ask chatgpt for a research summary and I'll have all the phrases I need to properly research it.\n\nI'm working on an Arduino project right now. I intend to use it for coding but haven't yet.\n\nI've used it as a shopping assistant.\n\nI had it summarize all the differences between a 2023 contract and the renewed 2024 contract.\n\nI intend to use it for Spanish practice once I'm done my Pimsleur program.\n\nI use it to generate advertising ideas like slogans (be careful here: there are some legal restrictions... but it's impossible to prove it wasn't thought up by a human).\n\nI find new uses literally every day.",
