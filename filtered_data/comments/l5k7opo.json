As a result, educational institutions have started to have a policy where they have a department that handles this and they evaluate the assignment and other things to see if there is an issue.\n\nThe better institutions that are adopting AI are using it collaboratively in a classroom and opening up for discussion. If a 0 was given and they used an AI detector, they can be taken to court over it if they refuse to reverse their decision.",
