    "body": "Hi u/AnticitizenPrime, regading what you say about being suspicious about close-sourced extensions I used to have the same concerns. But, I realized that all browser extensions are just Javascript code installed in your browser directory, so despite of being minified (and even obfuscated), the code can be accessed and inspected, becoming in some sense open source, isn't it?\n\nExtensions when first published to the Chrome Web Store (or whatever) are first reviewed, aren't them? I don't know about the review process, but I want to think that they go though any process to avoid malware as Javascript is not a compiled language should be easy to give those checks good credit, right? Of course that an update could introduce a backdoor or ilegitime behavior, but I guess that's not the goal of Harpa AI as a monetized (freemium) extension.  \n  \nEven, for open-source extensions, I can't see any guarantee that the extension installed from the browser store matches the published code on Github/Gitlab/...\n\nWhat do you think on all of these? Thanks!",
