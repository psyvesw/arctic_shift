    "body": "I'm not defensive, I think AI is going to revolutionize education. I just think OP has no idea what they are talking about when they think that teachers are going to be completely replaced. You still need someone to carry the carrot/stick. Just look at COVID. \n\nRight now we realistically need 20-30% more teachers than we currently have to fully meet the needs of students. Ideally AI closes that gap by increasing teacher productivity and allows for much more advanced scaffolding and individualized education. It's already helping me do that. \n\nUntil AI can carry out instruction with activities that involve multiple modalities in real 3D space, it won't be fully replacing teachers.",
