    "body": "That only lasts so long though. Eventually the bigger companies, slow moving as they are, will fully adopt AI in three same way. \n\nI\u2019m not talking about the apples, googles, and amazons of the world. I\u2019m talking about ad agencies. \n\nI work for a company that is owned by blackstone, and they recently sent out an email asking employees to submit a paper describing a way that adopting AI would help them in their roles. That only happened in the last month, and blackstone will have potentially thousands of responses across all of their businesses. \n\nOnce these companies capitalize on AI, entrepreneurs will lose their advantage again and have a harder time breaking in. Status quo except with new tools. \n\nAI is fantastic and makes life easier, but it does the same thing for the corps.",
