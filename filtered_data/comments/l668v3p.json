    "body": "I have a daughter who's struggling with reading and is below her grade level. I've found a way to help her that's pretty fun and effective. Here's what I do:\n\n1. I use an ChatGPT to generate sight words she should know.\n2. Then, I have it create short stories (just a couple of sentences per page) using a few words she doesn't know yet, focusing on genres or topics she's interested in.\n3. I feed a prompt into an ChatGPT that generates children's book illustrations for each page of the story.\n4. After that, I quickly put everything into Canva and make a personalized book for her.\n5. She can then read it on my iPad, and it's tailored to what she needs to learn while being something she enjoys.\n\nIt's been a great way to make reading practice enjoyable and effective for her!\n\n\nI even rewrote this with 4o. Shhhh",
