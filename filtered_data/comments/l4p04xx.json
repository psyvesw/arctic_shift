    "body": "1) my wife who can't code, used it to write a vba macro for Excel. She is in hr and her hr software exported terribly formatted data that meant taking averages on an employee survey was hard. I helped a bit but she got chatgpt to write a macro that organised the data better so that she could use pivot tables. A task that took her 3 days last year took 30 mins with this macro.\n\nShe won \u00a3150 as a bonus for winning employee of the month.\n\nThat was early days.\n\n2) our company has tried to switch to selling ai services. We had already built a claims management system and automated a lot but one particular step we struggled with and managed to use ai for it. So that's potentially won us tens of thousands for years if we can get a second contract we're bidding on. Of course that's not all profit and it's not all ai. But ai has enhanced what we've done and I think helped us win vs competitors.",
