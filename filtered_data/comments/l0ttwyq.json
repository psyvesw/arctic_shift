    "body": "Which jobs? . Something tells me we'll be destroying jobs faster than they are created.  It's not that AI is an advance in say, agricultural production. It can theoretically replace ALL \"intellectual\" fields at the same time.\n\nI have used AI to write code, learn foreign languages, and learn about Canadian Duties and Taxes. It can design meal plans, generate images, and solve complex math equations.  \n\nWhich skills can you learn to keep yourself \"safe\"? Python? Machine Learning? Creative Writing? AI is already there.\n\nCorporations will face an inevitable contradiction. They  fire more workers and replace them with AI, but as all companies do the same, in order to maintain profitability, they will need to automate more, firing more workers. But this leads to massive unemployment, causing profitability to fall, meaning more automation is required to stay competitive.\n\nThe more they automate, the more they will be forced to to cut costs as less people are able to afford the goods and services from the corps.",
