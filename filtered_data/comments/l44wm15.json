    "body": "ChatGPt is a really bad therapist. It validates a lot but is not critical in any way or trying to look at deeper motives. Furthermore a core skill of social workers is (or better: should be) dealing with difficult emotions. Otherwise you wont be able to do the job. Maybe it will change in the future, but currently a talk with my coworkers is miles ahead. Thats also not suprising imo considering they too know these emotions, they too are skilled in dealing with emotions, they often know my clients, they know me very good and how I deal with stuff, and they see patterns where GPT-4 doesn't.\n\nAnd most important: GPT-4 currently holds no real emotional capacity. Atleast not close to humans. This may change in the future though.\n\nI am currently doing my masters and for that gpt-4 is useful. But in my work life I have found no (legal) use yet. Though with gpt-4o I see a lot of uses for my clients which would be great and save me lots of times. Sadly, I doubt most want to learn a new technology...\n\nThank your for your input :)!",
