I'm saying, that for many people it's not something that you notice usually...and it just reverts to GPT-3.5 when you reach the limit anyway.\n\nOf course there's a difference, but I'm sure that for 90%+ of people - this is certainly enough and won't hurt them really in anyway.\n\nAnd I know that it can lie, but it is supposed to know what it is. I'm pretty sure it is GPT-4 in voice mode, and it does make sense that it's limitless - or just a high limit",
