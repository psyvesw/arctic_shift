    "body": "You make a big assumption, which is that the correct answer is to find a random number, generated by a library providing psuedorandom numbers. \n\nWhen a human is asked to pick a number between 1 and 100, they ALSO have the capability to execute python code, but they don't. \n\nSomething that's actually pretty interesting is actually how good a job it's able to do generating random numbers, even accounting for humanlike biases.\n\nWhen you consider the way a GPT decides to pick tokens, the fact that it kind of covers the whole space is actually pretty awesome.  I mean, the temperature does have to be reasonably high, but consider that one agent has no idea what any other agent has ever picked, these are independent events.\n\nOf course a GPT is going to have human biases.  If you ask someone to pick a random number between 1 and 100, they're going to think it's broken if it picks 1. Even though 1 is just as likely as any other number, like 37.  37 is going to feel a lot more \"random\". The whole point of a GPT is to generate a result that seems right. \n\nA conversation with someone who picks \"1\" as a random number between 1 and 100 1% of the time is going to feel wrong.",
