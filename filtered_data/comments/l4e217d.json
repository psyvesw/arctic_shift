    "body": "Honestly i really like the aesthetic from OpenAi.\n\nI mean, off course \"its on purpose\" \"its a lie\" \"its completely calculated\" but like...obviously ? Like the humor in a Burger King add or anything made by a big company.\n\nBut thats being said, i really like the modern/cosy/home feeling of there background, and even if once again its obviously on purpose, i think its an excellent choice and a good advertisement for the company.\n\nGoogle is wtf ugly as f*ck \ud83d\ude05 and honestly if openAi had make their presentation on a classic \"TED talk\" set like we often see, it would not gave the same feeling.\n\nI think its not the aesthetic that people are critizicing, but the \"fakeness\" of choosing a somewhat natural et cozy aesthetic",
