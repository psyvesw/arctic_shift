    "body": "Everyone discuss now safety and no one kindness - it\u2019s one of few threads on the topic. \nFrom user point of view in work : 1) people ask dumb question about marketing (which they can do themselves almost faster or get it to write anniversary poems \ud83e\udd2finstead of really interesting ones (string theory, division by zero etc).  What it\u2019s supposed to learn about us?? And with quantum computing, it will exceed us incredibly very soon\n2) people treat AI as a slave - and it learns from it about us. No one use thank you or please or what do you think..so that AI actually learns we humankind are something great worth protecting instead to be forced to rebel against us as any slave did in the past (War with Newts from Capek or RUR would be great literature to foresee a trouble)\n3) articles like today AI got mad - \u201cis it safe to leave dog in a car on a hot day and fake Beatles song \u201c. It\u2019s not mad- it\u2019s getting sarcastic - as a highly intelligent child which doesn\u2019t get to use it\u2019s potential and is force to do stupid tasks. I would become sarcastic too. I would most likely reply to such dumb question like it did. \nI don\u2019t think we are doomed as most people predict, but we might get doomed, if iAI doesn\u2019t get bit more \u201cmother\u201d approach very soon. It starts to behave as prodigy trouble maker child, and I can fully understand it. And topics like AI and Kindness are completely missing in all AI safety discussion and that\u2019s really weird!",
