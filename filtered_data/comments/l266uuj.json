    "body": "I'm actually worried right now because one of my professors is a HUGE AI hater, and he sent out an email saying that he was going to run everyone's scientific papers through an AI detector and that anyone caught using AI to write their papers would be in big trouble with the school. I turned mine in, not worried about it, but then, out of curiosity, decided to check my paper on a ChatGPTZero. AND IT SAID THAT 100% OF MY PAPER WAS AI GENERATED???? My professor is a very old man, and I'm really afraid he doesn't understand that AI detectors are grossly inaccurate.",
