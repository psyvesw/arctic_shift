    "body": "I disagree. ChatGPT 4 was really impressive when it was unveiled, but since then, we've mostly had empty promises, like SORA, and vague statements about how good ChatGPT is going to be in the future. \n\nAnd it's always about the future with Altman. [He's freely admitted that today, ChatGPT isn't that great](https://fortune.com/2024/03/19/sam-altman-chatgpt-4-kind-of-sucks/), but there seems to be real problems OpenAI are facing to seriously improve ChatGPT, in terms of hardware, energy, finance, and data sets. For now, the company is stalling.\n\nAnd Sam is a hype man. That's what he needs to do right now to keep the money flowing from Microsoft. He's learned a lesson with Musk and Tesla. Tesla are in a really bad position at the moment, but Musk can just give vague pronouncements in investor calls about how Tesla is close to cracking self driving, or how it's an AI company now and not a car maker, or how they're going to launch robotaxis (spoiler, Tesla won't be), and the Tesla share price rebounds. It's all empty promises made to credulous idiots who really should know better, and Sam has started doing the same with OpenAI.\n\n> There is no empty hype here. If you don't see it, you aren't paying attention.\n\nNo offence, but maybe you need to look a bit closer.",
