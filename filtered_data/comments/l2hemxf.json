    "body": "Claude isn\u2019t available in my country. Used a VPN and I disliked the design in general. No free trial to see what it can do.\n\nGemini is good, I used the free trial but I think out of all 3, Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini, the Information it gives is the most unreliable. I don\u2019t really trust it at all. \n\nIf I could I would subscribe to all of them, but that\u2019s too expensive for me. I\u2019m also in school, and I mostly use ChatGPT to help me when in need. It\u2019s extremely useful and I\u2019m the most familiar with it.\n\nNow much rarer though because Gemini AI is superior in writing stories/creativity which is what I spend most of my time with when using AI-\nexcept for support with homework.\n\nSo now I have to choose between these two, because if I buy both subscriptions then it\u2019s going to be like ~40\u20ac a month and my pocket money is 80\u20ac. That\u2019s damn expensive, unless I leave out ChatGPT when there\u2019s like summer vacation which would save me money but in the long run still be expensive. I\u2019m in a dilemma \ud83e\udd37",
