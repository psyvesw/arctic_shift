    "body": "There are no 'signs' in the grand scheme of things though - it's trivial to prompt chatGPT etc to write in a way that does not bear any of the hallmarks of having been written by AI, other than the fact the it might be better written than the reader is expecting.\n\nThe genie is out of the bottle. People will use these things for written works, just like people will use calculators to do math. It's the stakeholders/employers/professors etc that need to adjust how they are creating their assessments.\n\nThey *can not know* with any certainty whether these tools are being used or not, so *they* need to adapt.\n\nIt's a massive headache for them of course, since this tool came from nowhere to immediately being everywhere, but that's the way it is.\n\nRuling that people are not allowed to use these tools is completely and utterly futile.",
