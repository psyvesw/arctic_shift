    "body": "AI is rapidly being integrated into search engines, browsers, and mainstream business platforms. Assume it\u2019s everywhere at this point. That said, your teacher should not be using it for grading. You are a high school senior about to embark on the real world. One of life\u2019s greatest lessons is to Worry About Yourself. In other words, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that person. Worry about why you\u2019re worried about that person.\u201d It\u2019s likely that years down the road, this teacher will mean nothing to you, if you will remember her name at all, or she will be long dead. My point is, some of your most future-shaping moments will be defined by what you\u2019re doing right now. Stressing over people that irk you allows that distraction to unnecessary offset your focus. There will be dumbass hypocrites everywhere in life. If the student body feels she is actually using AI to grade, then that is something that should be presented  **collectively** by the class group to administration. Do your best in this class, and move forward.",
