    "body": "I think it is not biased but going off of statistics and statistically\u2026I\u2019m a lot more likely to be sexually assaulted (1 in 3) by a man than attacked by a bear.\n\nChatGPT said to me: \n\n\u201cAccording to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, in 2020 there were an estimated 757,022 aggravated assaults in the United States committed by males. This doesn't include all assaults, only aggravated assaults which involve serious bodily injury or use of a deadly weapon.\n\nIn contrast, bear attacks on humans are extremely rare. A 2019 study documented around 183 bear attacks resulting in injury in North America from 2000-2015, an average of about 12 per year. The majority of these attacks involved defensive behaviors by female bears with cubs rather than predatory attacks.\n\nStatistically, a person is at far greater risk of assault by a human male than a bear attack. However, the specific risk scenario of encountering a man vs. a bear in the woods is hard to quantify since most assaults by men take place in homes, businesses and urban areas rather than remote wilderness areas where bears live.\n\nIf directly encountering an aggressive bear in the woods, the bear would likely pose the greater immediate threat in that specific situation. But overall, a person has a much higher probability of being assaulted by a man in their lifetime than being injured by a bear. It's important to put the relative risks in perspective.\u201d",
