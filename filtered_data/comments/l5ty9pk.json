    "body": "Your writing and reasoning skills are atrocious. This is the problem when you derive all of your opinions from your college professors: you are not capable of thinking through something even and formulating a coherent argument. Please reread what you wrote in this comment.\n\nYour bitcoin example proves my point fantastically. It's laughable that you don't see it.\n\nIf you try to sell me a bitcoin for $100K, even though the market price of bitcoin is $70K, then I will not buy it from you and will instead buy it from someone else. That means that you will not be able to sell your bitcoin and make any profit at all. The reason you would fail to make a profit in this example is precisely because you failed to provide customer satisfaction. The only possible way a customer would be satisfied by purchasing bitcoin is to purchase it at the market price. The only possible way for you to make profit trading bitcoin is to have first purchased it from someone else at a lower market price and then later selling it at a higher market price.\n\nIt's literally wild that you don't see that, and that you offered this an an example of how I am wrong.\n\nIf OpenAI starts charging $100 per month for ChatGPT, then I will stop using ChatGPT and will instead start using Gemini.\n\nSeriously, try thinking for yourself for once in your life. Stop just taking what your college professors say at face value and question what they are telling you.\n\nYour last paragraph is so poorly written I cannot even understand what you are getting at. Please try again.",
