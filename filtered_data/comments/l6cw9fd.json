    "body": "I actually thought you were an antinatilst based on your first comment. \n\nI mean, if someone was doing it for fun (torturing the AI) then that would be obviously wrong, but what if it's for research and the goal is to help humanity? Take animal tests for example. The tests are not nice, it's actually the opposite, but they are needed (to people). And we just kinda accepted that it's just how it is, right? Isn't it the same with AGI research? The only difference is that it's new. So I think it's fine to try to develop AGI but it has to be done ethically (well as much as possibly) just like the animal tests are being done. But yeah I think it's safe to say that someone is going to torture AGI some day",
