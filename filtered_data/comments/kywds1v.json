    "body": "Here's what ChatGPT says about this:\n\n>It seems that the concern expressed here is about the naturalness and authenticity of language use, especially in the context of distinguishing human-written text from that generated by AI like ChatGPT. The tweets suggest that certain words or phrases may be over-represented in AI-generated text, which can be a telltale sign for identifying such content.\n\n>\n\n>The underlying point is valid: AI language models tend to use certain words with a frequency that might not match typical human usage. However, rejecting content based solely on the presence of specific words can be problematic. It can exclude well-crafted human-generated content simply because it uses vocabulary that AI also tends to use.\n\n>\n\n>The discussion about language learning is also interesting; indeed, non-native speakers might rely on \"written-first\" language due to their learning pathways, which often include written materials or formal education settings. The way people learn languages can heavily influence their use of vocabulary in both written and spoken forms.\n\n>\n\n>It's important to recognize that language is dynamic, and its usage evolves with time and through different mediums. While AI might currently have certain linguistic signatures, it's also continuously improving to mimic human-like language more closely. As AI-generated content becomes more indistinguishable from human-generated content, the conversation may shift from spotting differences to understanding and addressing the implications of such advancements.",
