I never broke a B+ on an essay in undergrad in engineering, despite substantial effort, and now I'm consistently getting A or A+!\n\nI was worried my use of ChatGPT on this would become a crutch, but actually I'm learning - I got the latest one to my desired quality in one try and just needed ChatGPT to confirm it was fine.",
