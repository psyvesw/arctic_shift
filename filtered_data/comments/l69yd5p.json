    "body": "jesus christ my guy no shit it wont help people whos jobs are mostly manual labour... \n\nand like you, this morning i walked into my lab, in a big research facility with a ton of other scientists and engineers, all people who could use it effectively to speed up their work. just because you havent \"interacted with\" people who could use it really means nothing. our lifestyles dictate the type of people we are around mostly.\n\nregardless, the bureau of labor statistics says 43% of jobs are \"professionals\" in the united states. \n\n`The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines the professional workforce as including all workers in the \u201cmanagement, professional, and related occupations\u201d group. The BLS goes on to divide this broad category into 10 distinct occupation groups. These groups, and the number of people working in them in 2020 are:`\n\n* \u00a0`Management occupations (18,564,000);` \n* `Business and financial operations occupations (8,578,000);` \n* `Computer and mathematical occupations (5,603,000);` \n* `Architecture and engineering occupations (3,169,000);` \n* `Life, physical, and social science occupations (1,627,000);` \n* `Community and social service occupations (2,717,000);` \n* `Legal occupations (1,882,000);` \n* `Education, training, and library occupations (8,902,000);` \n* `Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations (3,042,000); and` \n* `Healthcare practitioner and technical occupations (9,559,000).`[`[1]`](https://www.dpeaflcio.org/factsheets/the-professional-and-technical-workforce-by-the-numbers#_edn1)\n\n`In total, there were 63,644,000 professionals working in these occupations in 2020, representing 43 percent of the total U.S. workforce.`\n\n  \nall of which could use chatgpt and other ai for speeding up and improving the quality of their work.",
