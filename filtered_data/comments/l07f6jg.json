As soon as all the labour the working class can provide is automated that's it, you will have no more right to live. You will be left to die. No more policies will be made to support or protect your right to live. You will not receive UBI because when everything the rich want is automated they won't need money from consumers to buy it. The only real world cost they will have is for access to information, energy and material resources, which they will likely just kill each other for.\n\nThere's going to be a lot of political coups in the coming years to control national mineral and infrastructure resources as they will be the only things that actually matter.",
