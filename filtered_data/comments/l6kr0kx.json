    "body": "Me (a lawyer) and my co-founder engineer at our startup, goHeather, built a tool that reviews contracts with AI. It's \"lawyer trained\" in the sense that I prompted it, gave it some precedents to learn and added some easy to use UI. Its early, and the design isn't there yet, but check it out. It's free to try without credit card, but you need a credit card if you want the full review of the document.\u00a0[https://www.goheather.io/ai-contract-review-app](https://www.goheather.io/ai-contract-review-app).\n\nIt's not a lawyer and will never be a lawyer. But its also a lot cheaper than a lawyer. I tell my friends to use it as a starting point.",
