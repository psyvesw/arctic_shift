    "body": "I used to think I couldn't ever be a coder, then when I learnt the basics I would see people writing emulators and stuff and think they were on a whole other level I could never reach. Fast-forward and I wish I could go back and tell myself that once you practice it enough and \"get it\" - it's all fucking easy, same with AI, don't give up, pick small simple goals and just keep on going. The problem is it's a whole new field so people expecting to be able to jump into the deep end due to being experienced software engineers learn they'll drown if they don't learn to paddle first.",
