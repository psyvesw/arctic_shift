    "body": "I don't think it's a case of people not having use for it as much as people just don't know HOW to use it efficiently. It was like this for me as well when the entire concept of AI chatbots dawned on me and at first it was just a curiosity.\n\nMy earliest attempts with ChatGPT were just using it as a Google alternative. I'd just ask it queries I'd otherwise be googling. Evidently Google search beat it here when ChatGPT was locked up until 2022.\n\nIt was only months later did I actually find chatbots useful for daily tasks. I'm somebody that gets swamped by personal tasks and interests, so I'd feed it my notes on things I did to help me stay organized. \n\nAlso as a study tool? Man, it's a perfect study tool. When you're studying a language this thing beats finding a vocab webpage. Ask ChatGPT to find something like most common words, then form sentences using those words, and then add/remove from there. Yes, there are learning apps, though AI has its benefits when you want to control what you're trying to study.\n\nAlso being able to upload files now has been amazing. I'm a free user so I can't upload many documents at a time or anything though it's been very helpful for things with a lot of line (talking thousands of lines here).\n\nBtw I should say I switch between ChatGPT and Gemini. No point in burning your silly and mundane prompts on 4o when you have unlimited free access to Gemini. I can also use Gemini for fun things like stories while using 4o for more important things.",
