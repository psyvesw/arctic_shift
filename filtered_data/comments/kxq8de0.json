    "body": "Im was in accounting, so I started with Excel Macros.\n\nIt started mostly with automation, crazy how much repetitive stuff can be automated, not just for work.\n\nAnd then I went for python cause I realised I still need to learn how code works and python seemed to be the most intuitive.\n\nI started by learning how to make a simple snake game in python and had ChatGPT act as a teacher with infinite patience that I could ask all the questions I wanted, no matter how simple or complex. If you don\u2019t get it, ask it to re explain things like you\u2019re 7.\n\nA year later, I\u2019m now more into game dev and making a game in Unity.\n\nLearning how to make a simple game in python can get you a lot of the basics down.\n\nBut I will say this, Chat is good at re explaining stuff. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s good at teaching stuff. I still prefer to watch YouTube tutorials alongside while I\u2019m learning something new.",
