    "body": "Well my shot is that we should expect new features about 2 months after first Microsoft Surface deliveries... which should take place around 20.06 if i'm correct? Why I think so? This hardware is supposed to have most of the presented functions \"inside it\". My shot is that GPT is not allowed to release their new features before Microsoft does that, in their own (pricy) way. I mean - why would anyone wanted to buy Surface Copilot+ with all it's great capabilities while could just buy normal laptop and use GPT by OpenAI? There would be no reason. These companies are cooperating together (or rather Microsoft is sugar daddy for OpenAI) and I expect OpenAI to follow the rules that Microsoft put on them.\n\nTo me this presentation was just huge flex. They showed what they got, what they can do and that they really improved efficiency. That last part is the most important actually - even Sama said that. Things like live video-speech reasoning is cool... But the idea that they were able to push gpt-4o to free users and most importantly cut the prices in half with smarter model... this is the most outrageous. That's real flex and challenge for their competitors.\n\nOne more thing - I'm in some way happy this features are not there yet. I mean, the advances and improvements are so fast that I did not yet introduce text gpt-4o in my projects and did not complete all my ideas. So partially I'm glad that it will take another few months because I can complete and learn what I have here now, before I start with the new features.",
