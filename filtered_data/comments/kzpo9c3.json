    "body": "I've seen posts in ChatGPT that hint it really is changing things.\n\nSomeone posted that they did some sort of work that involved hiring writers, and then he realized he can't run his business competitively anymore because everyone else is dropping prices and using AI.\n\nLiterally struggling NOT to fire people and was kind of alerting people his own aspect, that it doesn't matter if he doesn't want to because his business won't survive if he continues to keep paying humans to do all the work AI can already do.\n\nAll these different AIs are getting massively better at a fast rate too. Midjourney isn't really fucking up with hands anymore. Of course there are still issues but these are getting improved and it's naive to think there's always going to be issues that make human artists invaluable.\n\nBusinesses will need to be competitive. Businesses can massively lower costs using AI. Humans are EXPENSIVE. They need wages plus health insurance and dental and all that shit, and time off, need to be trained, leave companies, need to retrain someone else, eventually retire. You have zero of those problems with AI.\n\nIt's going to get people laid off whether people want to do that or not. A capitalist environment which doesn't heavily regulate AI will replace humans with AI, and I'm not even implying regulating it is going to be effective or need to happen. Something will have to be done to protect people though, because by default capitalism is going to be like \"fuck you artist you're not cost effective\" and throw them out of the system they need to be in to survive.",
