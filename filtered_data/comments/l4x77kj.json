    "body": "I knew what I was asking for.  I was just testing to see how well it could respond to me asking a question like this.\n\n>You left out a lot of required information and expected the AI to fill in the blanks, which is an unrealistic expectation.\n\nCorrect, that is what I was trying to test.  My *hope* is you could use AI for a task like this to help learn and understand what needs to get done even as a complete beginner.  Ideally it would go through all those assumptions and try and figure out how much I needed to buy vs. just confidently giving me a number and telling me how many to buy.  \n\nThe AI is *supposed* to be smarter and better informed than me.\n\nMaybe a more detailed prompt explaining that I didn't know what I was doing may have helped.  But like my previous comment, I think confidently spitting out wrong answers is worse than no answer and current LLM's are tuned to give any output.",
