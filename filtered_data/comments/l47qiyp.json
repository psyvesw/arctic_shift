    "body": "Its all very magical until you know the trick. A hammer cant build a house by itself. Learn how to use it and you can build anything. \n\nChatgpt is no different than a hammer. By itself it can't do anything and it is FAR from AI. Its simply quickly computed statistics. You have to learn how to use it as a tool or you WILL get burned if you let your guard down.\n\nI'm a 15+ year software developer who has learned how to use it for small projects but it is OFTEN wrong. Even when I correct it, it will repeat lies and inaccurate code.\n\nIs it cool? Absolutely. Point is, its a tool. Dont heavily rely on it.",
