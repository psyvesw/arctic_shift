    "body": "Me? Not at all - quite the opposite. I learned as much from \"ChatGPT\" as from my favorite university professors back in the day, I hands-down think! -- BUT, I perfectly understand where you're coming from.\n\nWho remembers Geography class? Exactly no-one. :P  \nOr, other way around: Who is NOT familiar with \"binge learning, barf reproducing \\[exams\\], fire and forget\"?\n\nOn the other hand, what stuck?  \nI'm sure a professor, a youtuber, a teacher, or a friend comes to mind.  \nBecause they had an \"engaging\" style.\n\nEngaging for a human brain means \"emotional\". My favorite one is \"humor\". Throw puns at everything.   \nRULE 1: DON'T BE BORING. RULE 2: There is no rule 2. Follow RULE 1.\n\nAsk ChatGPT to excessively AIsplain in the #comments in Python for a simple script. Or ask it to #AIsplain arbitrary words like a linguistic nitpicker in appending a \"Did you know?\" after every paragraph.\n\nI learned about \"defenestration\" from GPT-4 the other day. Capital punishment by throwing the offender out the window. WTF.   \nE\\_NOCONTEXT, which is why I cracked up about it (it probably got that from context \"MS Windows\" somehow). \n\nThen, I had the AI come up with a punishment for my code. It came up with \"perpendicular pronouncement\" and went on a rant about a jury of vectors, lol. It just hallucinated that entirely. xD\n\nAnd guess what - yes, that ends up saving no time at all, it takes as long as a Google search would have taken. Minus the frustration. Plus some laughs.   \nAND - emotional hack! - I actually remember the context around the puns pretty darn well. Emotion is what encodes memory in the human brain.  \n\n\nSo, I:\n\nUse custom instructions that prompt the AI to share and AI-splain stuff even when I didn't ask for it. -> I get curious -> I make a pun -> Next time, I suddenly remember that I actually know how to write that boring script myself, the script I just wanted to ask ChatGPT-4 about.\n\nHere are my current custom instructions (see \"Proactive Suggestions\"): [https://pastebin.com/2sKpWyR8](https://pastebin.com/2sKpWyR8)\n\nReal application case of 'GPT-4 proactively suggests': AdaBelief optimizer. I make pun about name, stating that \"I don't like the idea of sending 'thoughts and prayers' to the GPU when training an AI -> GPT-4 picks up on \"belief\" pun -> amusement = positive valence, high arousal (emotion category) -> same area as \"curiosity\" -> GPT-4 continues AI-splaining -> I feel curiosity & gratitude for my \"Professor GPT\" -> AdaBelief, the AI's suggestion, is now integrated in my code.  \\[attached\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i9wsxyzgitxc1.png?width=1469&format=png&auto=webp&s=954352ea16e20ecea5436df17951245387bec496\n\n\n\nAnd hell, I absolutely do remember that, you bet! :-D\n\nWon't work if you are bored to s\\*\\*t from the work you do, and / or actually \\*need\\* to save the time by using AI (and can't waste it on AI-puns instead of getting frustrated by \"good question, poor answer\" sites).\n\nDoesn't have to be humor, either. Can even be negative emotions. Whatever floats your boat, just don't be in a \"disengaged\" state. That's how your favorite influencer does it, too. And you don't need a mind on the \"other side\" to benefit from this hack!",
