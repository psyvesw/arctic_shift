    "body": "I find I often use it in the space between multiple systems. For example I might be working on an EC2 instance running some program using Docker and I'm having a connection issue. AI can often help figure out which system the problem lies in quicker than I could\n\nSimilar scenario recently where I had to install some DB and I was running into strange errors. I went through the DB documentation, couldn't figure it out, asked chatgpt and it correctly identified that it was a issue with the OS, something I probably wouldn't have narrowed it down to for a good while given the nature of it\n\nWhile I'm doing things like that I'll often ask it to expand a bit with some questions just so I can learn a bit more",
