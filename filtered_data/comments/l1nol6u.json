    "body": "Nah, teachers aren\u2019t the same as children. They work with children and often have multiple degrees just as lawyers and doctors or engineers. We don\u2019t treat lawyers like criminals or doctors like patients , we accept that while some are better or worse they are expert in their field. We don\u2019t comment on the fact they have secretaries to type up case depositions and receptionists to sort file and order patient data. \u2018Hey stop that doctor! He doesn\u2019t know his patient because the receptionist wrote up the case files! And the doctor referenced a medical journal! Or used chatgpt to produce a handout on epilepsy. No. The public, if they want to comment on administrative practices can go get higher degree in education then spend years developing their skills, then manage hundreds of socially, intellectually and behaviourally challenged kids and their entitled snd often rude parents. If they still have an issue with the source of the handout produced by their underpaid and abused colleague they can moralise and see how far it gets them . If they are just armchair critics, exerting an imaginary expertise because they failed three subjects at school and need to shore up their fragile internet based power they can go jump.",
