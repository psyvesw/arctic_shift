    "body": "Dude, nobody really \"knows\" how LLMs work yet.  That [thing that Anthropic did with Claude and the Golden Gate Bridge](https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude) was a really cool exploration into it.\n\nI'm M57, also with a background in software.  I have \"evaluated\" (played with) several LLMs.  I love that I can ask any question, and get an impressive reply. I *am* sceptical with some of the answers, but I can verify most things if needed.  But of course I ask a lot of programming questions!\n\nI also want to learn about AI, LLMs, neurons, etc.  I started to write, just for fun and my understanding, my own neutral network from scratch in C.  I'll repeat -- for fun!  But when I looked into what was involved in the training, I gave up.  I'll probably get back into it one day, but I'll use Python. \n\nI got a few LLMs to help me learn Dart.  I'm using it to write my own LLM API client library.  My favorite project is an LLM \"fingerprinting\" project.  I call it VK (after Voight-Kampff).  The idea is to ask questions that reveal something about the LLM to the point where you can tell which AI you are chatting with.\n\nI have tried services where you can pick the AI from a drop-down.  Sometimes I wondered if it was working.  Have you ever asked an AI which one it was? \n\nTo learn more about AI, just ask them more questions.  Listen to podcasts. Try stuff.  Have you tried Ollama yet?",
