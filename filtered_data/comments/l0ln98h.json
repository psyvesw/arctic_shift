    "body": "Generative AI will not initially fill the STEM gap.\u00a0 It might create new jobs in some STEM fields, and it might reduce jobs in some STEM fields.\u00a0 What it is guaranteed to do, however, is make a lot of jobs in more \"creative\" fields, like graphic design or writing, obsolete.\n\n\nOther technologies, perhaps involving generative AI, will probably eventually take over the rest of the STEM fields, except perhaps the most theory-dense research fields.\n\n\nThe safest jobs will probably be trades like plumbing/electrical and human-focused jobs like nurse and therapist.\n\n\nI don't think any of this is a reason to avoid going into STEM, though.\u00a0 If AI really will render 80% of the economy's jobs obsolete, we're all fucked, regardless of degree (unless we roll out some massive changes to the way people obtain resources).\u00a0 Try and make some money and have some fun in STEM before that happens!",
