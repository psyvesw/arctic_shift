    "body": "Yeah, when Manufacturing got booked during the 90s with the WTO and huge outsourcing to China, white collar workers mumbled \"learn to code\".\n\nSorry/ not sorry. A lot of white collar work will be obsolete. The relative value of trades and manufacturing will increase; and many of us who were crushed by previous economic changes are looking forward to it.\n\nThis will also come with dramatically lower admin overhead for many organizations, so there will be more money to spend on physical goods, versus getting sucked into expensive office work.\n\nYou have to adapt to the times. Learn to weld. HVAC is hugely in demand, and will be more so as energy requirements go up. And manufacturing is seeing a Renaissance as Trump implemented, then Biden continued, the tariffs on China.\n\nGenerative AI means one senior financial analyst can do the work of what previously required 20 people.\n\nAcademia, primary, secondary, and collegiate is loaded with Administrative Staff. 75% of those will be obsolete, too; and good riddance. It will bring college costs down, and expense can coalesce around teaching staff.",
