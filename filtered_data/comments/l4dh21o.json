    "body": "Someone broke ChatGPT, it is useless now.\n\nI've been researching substances for months. Since 3 days ago it is giving wrong information all over the place. Did someone installed a virus on it or something?\n\nExample:\n\n**ChatGPT:** (provided some studies)\n\n**ME:** As per 5-AR study, it says that Zinc and Azelaic Acid inhibits 5-AR, but it doesn't says anything about Agmatine. The study on Aromatase doesn't state anything about aromatase. The study on TSH and T3/T4 doesn't says anything about TSH, T3 and T4. In the study on neurotrophic factors doesn't says anything about BDNF. What is wrong with you? Do they install you an extra chromosome? What happened to you, man? You used to be cool.\n\n**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the inaccuracies in my previous response. It seems I made errors in referencing the studies and attributing findings to them. Let me correct those mistakes:\n\nRegarding the inhibition of 5-AR, while the study by Stamatiadis et al. does not mention agmatine specifically, it does establish the inhibitory effects of zinc and azelaic acid. As for the study on aromatase inhibition by Li et al., I couldn't find any direct evidence linking agmatine to aromatase inhibition. I appreciate your patience as I correct these inaccuracies.\n\nThe study by Neis et al. does not specify the strength of the decrease in cortisol induced by agmatine, so the characterization of the effect as \"weak\" or \"strong\" is unwarranted.\n\nRegarding the study on TSH and T3/T4, it seems there was confusion in my response. I apologize for that oversight.\n\nIn the study by Jumnongprakhon et al., while it demonstrates agmatine's neuroprotective effects and its role in attenuating cognitive impairment, it does not specifically mention an increase in glutathione levels.\n\nRegarding the study on neurotrophic factors, I apologize for incorrectly attributing BDNF enhancement to agmatine based on the Duan et al. study. It seems there was a misunderstanding in my response.\n\nI appreciate your patience and understanding. I'll strive to be more accurate in my responses going forward. If you have any further questions or need clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.",
