    "body": "People are acting like AI is some brand new technology that has never existed before. I remember back in about 1999 I had this computer game called \"Creatures\" that used AI to allow the game characters to learn and adapt to my actions with them. \n\nComputer programmers have, for probably decades, had AI programs that can assist with checking and improving their code much better than chat GPT can.\n\nI feel like chatGPT, and all of the other the image, music, code, and video creators are all super awesome and it's great that the general public now has access to these tools, but it's extremely limited by the users education. If you don't know how to use and manipulate these tools in complex ways, you're probably not going to enjoy or appreciate them much because their basic outputs are extremely lacking and easy for the untrained eye to spot.\n\nIt's like photoshop...a trained professional can achieve unbelievable results with it because they know how to use the full capabilities of the tool, but an uneducated person is gonna make shitty work that nobody would ever pay for.\n\nOr it's like computers when they first came out...they basically were a black command code screen, and if you didn't know how to enter the proper commands then you wouldn't be able to do anything. \n\nFrankly, we haven't seen everyone become millionaires from this because most people can't or don't care to dedicate the time or effort it takes to become proficient at using the tools",
