    "body": "The thing is there is a chance your paper will set off \"AI detectors\" even if you didn't use AI at all. Those things are notoriously unreliable. \n\nThat's why these days it's important to keep some evidence of the fact that you have actually been working. If you have some proof of library visits or purchasing research materials, keep them. Keep copies of each draft. Keep copies of any notes you make. Make sure your bibliography/citations are all set. Stuff like that.\n\nSorry, I don't mean to make you more anxious. I'm not saying it's likely to happen but it's something to keep in mind. If it does I'd be extremely selective and careful about my next words. You don't want to lie, but blurting out something like \"well I used chatgpt to improve my paper\" could be misinterpreted as an admission. I'd emphasize that the paper was written and edited by you and that chatgpt was used in a minor capacity to bounce ideas off of in the same way you might a friend. I've had many friends do similar things to what you did; send me bits of their paper and ask my thoughts on it. I would sometimes suggest changes and a lot of times they make them. This minor level of contribution usually doesn't get you an author credit so I don't see why that should change for chatgpt.",
