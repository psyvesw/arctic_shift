    "body": "> Through two-way conversation\n\nYour comment is giving me a lot of insight as to why I'm struggling so much with \"talking\" with chatGPT and other ai. I was under socialized as a kid and struggled a lot with communication skills, and I spent a lot of time in therapy as an adult trying to navigate conversation. I mean I literally got write ups at my first few jobs and detention in grade school because of miscommunication and stupid shit I didn't mean to say.\n\nAlthough I've gotten better at real life communication, every time I open that chat box I'm like omg how do I get this thing to give me the results I want (we both end up confused most of the time). I end up going back to Google search or Wikipedia and getting the info I need there, conversating is hard \ud83d\ude2d",
