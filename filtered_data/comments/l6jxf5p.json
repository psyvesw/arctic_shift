    "body": "True. But I don't think it's that deep, really. Consider a computer vision program that represents colors as numbers from 0 to 255 (1 byte). Another more powerful program might represent them as 0 to 65535 (2 bytes). Many modern machines use 0 to 16+ million, which is 3 bytes, plus an extra byte to represent opacity (the \"alpha channel\").\n\nOf course these computers and the programs they run don't have experiences (as far as we know!) but if they did, the experience of color would presumably be different in all those cases. There doesn't really seem to be any big mystery there - how you experience something is dependent on how your sensory systems are implemented.\n\nThe big, unsolved question is how we \"experience\" anything at all, in the sense of having a conscious awareness of that experience. Why do we have that kind of conscious experience but, as far as we know, computers don't? Does ChatGPT have such experience? Or as the philosopher Thomas Nagel put it, \"[what is it like to be a bat?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F)\"",
