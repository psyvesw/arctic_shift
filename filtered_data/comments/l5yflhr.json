    "body": "They are closer in timbre than that broad brush. In the Venn diagram, they are indeed within that category of women, upper class is a stretch. White?  OK, in that category too, not necessarily from California since plenty of other locales can have the same inflections. Yeah, I got your point, but they are closer in sound than other voices that also fit in your category.\n\nI didn't hear ScarJo when I first heard 'Sky', but I definitely hear ScarJo rather than Amber Heard, Jolie, insert other female celebrities voice.\n\nAll that being said, it should be clear that OpenAI was going for 'her' voice from the start, and I personally don't see that as a problem, just as some company wanting to have a Hal-like voice. \n\nImagine if you wanted to use a Hawking-like voice back when all the artificial voices sounded like Hawking.
