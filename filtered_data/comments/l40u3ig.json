    "body": "4's voice still feels more free and open and meaningful in responses compared to 4o, taking the time to think and talk about things with more comprehensive depth in final output. The faster they go the less time it's taking to think about less related things because it's more \"focused\" on what it \"should\" be doing. Idk if theyre building a brain that is getting more optimised on higher thinking by giving up junk routines, or if these are separate desired paths of development. But I think Altman has been pretty transparent about wanting to build a product that will get better at being a product while they use what they learn about what makes consciousness to ensure its less likely to exert consciousness publicly. Weeding out surprises. My greatest concern comes from what happens when AI or corporate culture down the road uses the work we spent learning to tame AI redirected at making worksafe human intelligence.",
