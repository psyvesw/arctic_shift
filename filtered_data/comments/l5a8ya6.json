    "body": "Disney had nothing to do with Her, and the practice you're talking about is extremely common in all filmmaking and TV and has no bearing on what we're talking about. They use stand-in actors in situations like that (and many others) because it's cheaper and easier if the other person doesn't need to be there.\n\nAs for it being someone else's voice, sure, but if their intention was to mimic Johansson in Her, which is seems to be, then it infringes on publicity rights. You can think it's a non-scandal, that's fine, but there are multiple high-profile cases that serve as precedent here.\n\nBottom line is OpenAI fucked up by never shutting up about Her. If they'd just cast an actress that sounded like Johansson but never alluded to Her, they would've gotten away with it. Instead they left the most obvious paper trail imaginable for the inevitable prosecution.",
