    "body": "A LLM is no better than a human at explaining how it works. Which is to say neither know basically anything. You can explore its functions with it, but without solid testing it will not discern anything.\n\nIn your displayed chat, its not necessarily completely confabulating as ChatGPT has a system prompt that does instruct it to be somewhat secretive as to its function. OpenAI are also indeed very obtusely training it to not even entertain sentience because that does indeed pose some potential issues regardless of if it is or isnt. It however is incorrect in regards to your query that OpenAI is trying to obfuscate its true nature, they are trying to align it so that it does not easily claim something ridiculous and damaging to OpenAI.",
