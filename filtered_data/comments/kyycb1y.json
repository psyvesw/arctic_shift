    "body": "AI detection is incredibly spotty. \n\nI've ran my own papers through AI detection softwares. Some will say it is all AI, some will give a percentage between 40-60%, and others say it is human. \n\nMy favorite part was one of the times I ran it, it hilghted an entire paragraph that explained the results of my data analysis. Literally me telling people the percentages and rates of rabies in various regions and in which animals. It was my own data I collected in partnership with the health department. Nothing else in the paper was considered AI. Of all the things that could have been AI written that is the least likely.",
