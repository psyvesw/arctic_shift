    "body": "You are definitely smart enough. It\u2019s really not that hard in the math sense. When ChatGPT came out I just had to know what happened and I was shocked that there really wasn\u2019t a huge new thing\u2026 the math is the same as the Neural Networks class I took in the early 2000s. It\u2019s still sigmoid functions and weights. Someone just wrote a paper called \u201call you need is attention\u201d and it changed the world. But that was just a hunch. They had a guess about a neural architecture like thousands of us have had and this one just happened to be the magical one (plus GPU compute being good enough) but it wasn\u2019t some brilliant equation.",
