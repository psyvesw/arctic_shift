    "body": "I was a kid with 5 1/4's but I feel ya. I've been knee deep in AI research for the past few years as it started to mainstream and every week I'm blown away by another technology. (Suno.ai, Heygen, Eleven labs come to mind) \n\nIf you don't already, spring for the paid GPT4 model. I use the voice chat with an elaborate set of custom instructions. I swear, it's like having a personal assistant always ready to talk. \n\nI connect to Bluetooth in my car, start a full on conversation. She (it's the \"Sky\" female voice) asks questions back which help me drill deeper into my thought process. It can retain the conversation in the thread.\n\nI can only imagine how useful it will be when it can remeber the context of all of our conversations, interact with my calendar to schedule or remind me of things.\n\nI literally ask it to do everything, then I come in and touch up or put a little human polish on it.",
