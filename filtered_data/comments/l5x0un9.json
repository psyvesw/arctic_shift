    "body": "I really want something similar to this, but intended to identify gaps in knowledge.  \n\nAbout a decade into being a self-taught developer, I still regularly encountered concepts and jargon I had never heard before. Usually in meetings, which can be embarrassing.  I've done so many tutorials, courses, etc. I rarely get much, if anything, out of them. Yet ... \n\nThe problem is that the more you learn the harder it becomes to encounter stuff you didn't.  Gaps in knowledge.  \n\nThe idea occurred to me that there should be testing that rapidly narrows down specific gaps. Not courses, but like \"here's 20 minutes worth of material on memoization.\"  Future testing will act a verification and reinforcement.  It would need to be AI-driven, otherwise you just end up replacing a bunch of content you already know with a bunch of tests that you don't need. (Hence my bringing it up here.)\n\nAnd really this \"test first\" approach could be applied to education at large.   What if finishing a certification or even degree boiled down to proof of mastery?  There are no more gaps to cover. \n\nWe have the ability to tailor education to the individual.  Why keep forcing people to sit through material they aren't benefitting from? Why use grades to show that there is still some material they needed more help with (and not bothering to actually help them - ?) This seems like a no brainer to me.  But too big of a concept to develop myself.",
