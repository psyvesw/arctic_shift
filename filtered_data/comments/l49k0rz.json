    "body": "I completely agree - I\u2019ve used it in so many ways and while once in a while its not the best, for the most part I find it incredibly useful. \n\nFrom getting quick tutorials on Linux commands, to feeding it pet and family blood work results for potential diagnosis, to asking it to summarize an article and provide bullet points for presentations, to brainstorming various scenarios for a work product, to asking for management / leadership advice, to feeding it anonymized resume content and a job posting and asking what I could improve on, to creating a google chrome extension from scratch (brainstorming how to approach scraping job posts on Indeed), to taking a picture of a plant / animal and asking for identification, to taking a picture of my kids math homework so I could help explain something I was fuzzy on, to drafting powershell scripts to manipulate data at work, to getting a potential list of kitten names, to using as a quick substitute for google for all kinds of research, to asking for recipe recommendations / inspiration, to brainstorming possible product titles, to feeding it html source code and asking how the site is working/where the site is getting x, to getting quick excel formulas, to brainstorming workout plans, to asking about medical symptoms and potential diagnoses, to asking it for top x sources/journals on (obscure topic), to feeding it a framework and then throwing data at it to assess where that data might best fit within that framework, to asking about strange car sounds, to brainstorming a project for my kid related to identifying how the arc for character x in some famous piece of literature might compare / contrast with well known fictional superhero characters (to make my kids homework assignment a little more interesting), and on and on and on. \n\nYes validating the responses is recommended for any important decision, and you can\u2019t blindly accept answers (I find myself sometimes asking \u201cwait you suggested step 1 then 3 but shouldn\u2019t there be a step 2 - answer is often oops, or even better an explanation as to why my logic may be wrong - either is great bc I\u2019m still learning as I review and think thru the ChatGPT response).\n\nI\u2019m also stunned people don\u2019t use it more and surprised to hear so many here comment that they don\u2019t see a use for it. If you deliberately try to use it for as much as possible over the span of a week, you\u2019ll stumble over SO many use cases. Basically any time one is stuck or wondering about something\u2026.",
