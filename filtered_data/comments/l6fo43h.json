    "body": "Legit been using GPT as a calculator equivalent for the past week or so, while I try and untangle a script that a human wrote that's full of things that don't make much sense from a performance and efficiency perspective. I can't focus in longer than 3 hour blocks, so having something like GPT available to help with debugging and testing has been a godsend. \n\nIn terms of 'AI' replacing programmers though? I don't think that'll happen, at least not for a super long time. A program can't develop and test things like a human can, or be creative in the same ways. They're also not very good at self governance, and will wreck themselves before checking themselves so to speak. Until LLMs can graduate into something with a sense of purpose, I'm not worried.",
