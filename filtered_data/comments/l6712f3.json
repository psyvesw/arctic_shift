    "body": "This may be a controversial take, but ... It depends on what the point of what you're doing is.\n\nFor example, if you are tasked with writing an essay for an English class, they are likely not concerned with the content of the essay as much as they are the logical and grammatical structure. In such a case, I would consider using ChatGPT to be cheating if you're using it to actually *write* the essay. But if you use it to help coach you on proper structure, or if you use it to critique your writing, you are using it like a tutor or editor, and that would not be cheating.\n\nIf you are writing a report or thesis, it's usually not as much about the structure as it about the ideas presented and proper citation of what inspires or informs your ideas. In this case, I would not consider having ChatGPT help with the construction of the thesis as cheating. But if you are using ChatGPT to do the thinking for you, coming up with the ideas, logic, sources, etc ... that would be cheating.\n\nThis is why the use of AI is going to be extremely controversial in schools. ChatGPT is a tool, and there are right and wrong ways to use it, with any given task. Determining after the fact HOW the tool was used in the construction of the work may be difficult if not impossible.",
