    "body": "It's a godsend when coding holy shit. I've never been able to ask basic questions like \"why do we name things that way\" or \"what do other programming languages do about this\" or \"what are the various ways people implement saving\". I set up full discussions about my code where I have to justify myself to the AI, so I can make sure I *really* understand.\n\nIt can turn a single function of pseudocode into actual code very very well, which can be fantastic for the stuff that is annoying to google or code, like \"create a function to make an svg line between 2 points\" or \"give me a function that decamelizes a word\".\n\nIt can do small refactors like make this for loop into a foreach, or this recursive method into an iterative one.\n\nI've started getting more complicated with it too. \"<This> is how the data is structured. Loop through it and get me only objects with this one value\". \n\nYou have to ask it one single complicated question with a definite answer - it's constantly trying to underexplain. When I say \"for each line of code, add a comment\" or something its asking for lots of little tasks, and has a *very* high chance of skipping it sometimes, like not including a line of code in the answer. Learn what it's good and bad at. \n\nI could actually teach a full college course at this point about how to use GPT in programming. It is *such* luxury.",
