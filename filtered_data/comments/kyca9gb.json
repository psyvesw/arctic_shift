    "body": "I don't think the issue at hand isn't that these AI text detectors are good or not. \u00a0I think you testing of the tool shows you that its highly effective.\n\nThe real issue is this\u2026. Should a teacher/professor use these tools as black and white decision on if the student have cheated on their work and use it as basis of failing the kids or expelling them from school\u2026 thus potentially cause lift changing event in the student\u2019s life?\n\nBelieve it or not, my neighbor is going through this right now for a 10th grad english class. \u00a0\n\nThe teacher is just pointing back to the result of the ai checker and not willing to look at any other evidence.\n\n\nHopefully they are successful in appealing this but this is happening right now in the schools now!\n\nUnbelievable!",
