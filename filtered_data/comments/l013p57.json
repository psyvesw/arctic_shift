    "body": "I\u2019ll be the contrarian here. This image doesn\u2019t display any of the known AI artifacts related to faces, clothes, body composition, etc. from commercially available image generators. While AI has improved significantly over the last couple of years, to the point that we absolutely should be questioning many images released to the mainstream, the question that SHOULD be asked here is what would be gained by generating and posting this image? What would this be intended to evoke if it\u2019s not real?\n\nFor those questioning the dirt on the bellies, you must have never met a deep-south southerner. That dirt is from leaning up to the bed of a filthy pickup truck, and those are some textbook git-yer-lite-beer-outta-here bellies and boobs.\n\nIn short, no. I do not perceive this to be AI generated. I could absolutely be wrong, of course, but I would expect to see at least SOMETHING that left a small artifact.",
