    "body": "I wish you all the best of luck.  Can you explain what you mean by growing?  Growing the team?  Growing the repertoire of information being used to teach the AI?  Growing your profits (it's free, but I figure money's pretty much always a factor somewhere).\n\nI'm always willing to give it another shake.  As I like to say, \"I'll try anything twice.  (First time might be a fluke).\"  Just not quite yet.  I'll give it more time to grow, as it were.  Sure, one year is huge in tech terms, but AI is still in its infancy, and as such, there is a lot of growth to do before such things become more stable.",
