    "body": "When Sam came back on within a week of the corrupt boards firing, Microsoft sided with him, most of open ai staff sided with him and the board was replaced the actions spoke louder than words about who lost the plot and it wasn't Sam Altman, they wanted his position. \n\nThe rest of these dudes are just a distraction and making noise because they were likely still working their but were no longer able to work on the major ai projects like before which is understandable. I say this because when you go to the contributions page for chatgpt4o I don't see Ilya's name on there unless I missed it. Him saying he was \"struggling for compute and it was getting harder and harder to get crucial research done\" also make me feel that's what happened. They lost the company and staff's trust and their ideas of the way forward for ai likely didn't align with everyone else.",
