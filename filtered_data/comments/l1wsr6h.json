    "body": "I took two programming classes in college. They were both C++. Actually, they were the exact same class, and I ended up taking it twice. I\u2019ve played with arduino, a little raspberry pi, Python used on the pi, but no truly original projects. Not until ChatGPT. Your video game is probably right on par with my skill levels pre-ChatGPT. \n\nPython is just a coding language. Popular, diverse, powerful, and everywhere. Anyone who says \u201cI\u2019m an expert in Python\u201d knows a lot, and a little. Python is so vast and expanding, no one can know all of it. The people who are best at Python know a few tools, and know them inside and out. But it\u2019s easy to pick up on when you\u2019ve got a goal in mind, and ChatGPT is a great teacher. You just have to be willing to learn, and ask it to teach you. \n\nGoogle apps scripts are fun. Say I have a Google doc, and a Google sheet. My doc is a template of a form I\u2019m sending to my students. I don\u2019t want to type up 30 forms. So I make a Google apps script. It\u2019s a little programming area. I can write a program in there that turns each row into a new doc that\u2019s a filled in version of the template, and save it wherever I want with whatever name I want. \n\nIf Bob, John, Jane, and Karen are in the sheet, it will make 4 new files, name them \u201cBob\u2019s Letter\u201d, \u201cJohn\u2019s Letter\u201d, etc, and save them in a folder titled \u201cLetters to Students\u201d. And that\u2019s just some basic stuff. I can make a function that adds a new menu with options to my doc, and run custom programs straight from there! I have one that converts all my student work samples into PDFs, and drops the PDFs into the proper submission folder on Google drive. It does them instantly. That\u2019s 30 less times I have to go into a doc, save as PDF, and upload to a new folder. \n\nI would start on YouTube for both, but especially Google apps scripts. Replicate exactly what someone else does. Then start tweaking it. Make it do something that actually makes your life easier, even if it\u2019s just one thing! Have it add your signature to a page, or fill in data from a Google sheet. Just make it do something.\n\nFor Python, lookup PyCharm. It\u2019s an IDE for Python that I greatly enjoy. Still go to YouTube, but you can also ask ChatGPT how to use it. It\u2019s good at giving directions to follow and helps with troubleshooting. \n\nChatGPT doesn\u2019t always take the most direct paths when programming. I may say, \u201cthis program needs to do x, y, and z, but it\u2019s doing x, then z, and. O things happening because it can\u2019t actually do a because it skipped x.\u201d And ChatGPT will say \u201coh, let\u2019s make it tell you \u2018I errored out\u2019 instead of fixing what\u2019s going wrong. You will learn to recognize those moments, and try asking it a different question to get to the answer you need.\n\nI now have my big program in 3 flavors: a demo, my personal version, and a version I use for coworkers (my alpha testers). It\u2019s over 1,000 lines of code, it navigates webpages, converts files, sends emails, takes screenshots, labels things, reads excel sheets, merges screenshots into PDFs, and can pick out what data I want based on the target date range associated with an assignment. It\u2019s a super fancy web scraper, but I couldn\u2019t have done it without ChatGPT. On my own, this would have been a lifetime endeavor. Probably would have had to go back to school to complete it. With ChatGPT, I\u2019ve become a self-taught programmer and gone through several iterations of this project in about a year and a half. And I\u2019ve only had the paid version of ChatGPT for 6 months, I made significant headway with 3.5 before that.\n\nMy experience with AI has been amazing. It\u2019s revolutionized my ability to do my job. I think if everyone got AI working for them the way it\u2019s worked for me, we\u2019d all get a lot more time off, and believe it or not, that\u2019s like my number one priority.",
