    "body": "Hi, we have developed a system where you can train your research papers. It can extract data from tables, graphs and especially extracts text in the right order. This mostly an issue with current platforms. Besides that it's trained on the structure of your papers and writing style and will convert the output in same format. Send me a message for more details, we have a beta in the running for small group of organizations.\n\nSo you can create multiple knowledge bases with specific papers, load in new related papers about a subject you have. And let our trained model write out different papers, case-studies, whitepapers, etc.\n\nAlso the chunks issue we solved. We don't chunk in 1000 for example, we check how big/small the chunk should be so that relevant information stays in the chunk. This gives amazing results for researchers.\n\nYou can use this in your own created GPT in ChatGPT which works very well on your trained documents and papers. Switching between your own GPT and Consensus works very well for fast research.\n\nHit me up for more details :)",
