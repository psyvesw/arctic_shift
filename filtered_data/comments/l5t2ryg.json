Here's what a regular interaction between me and AI looks like (which is why I don't use it).\n\n  \nIt basically just does this same loop over and over again without giving any useful advice. It can't derive things from the code that I give it to inform its answers, as it will tell me to do things that are already in the code, and it will tell me that it's too complicated when the actor is only one object, etc.\n\nIt's just a complete waste of time.
