    "body": "I feel like the rebuttal to your comment should be something along the lines of pointing out the skill of prompt engineering. Like there's going to be college courses very soon (if there isn't already) on how to use chatgpt to it's fullest potential. It's truly a tool that needs used like one. One tool can't do all jobs, and while chatgpt can handle many, many jobs very well, there is obvious limitations. And by knowing those limitations along with all its strengths and abilities, and by being able to be taught how to use LLMs to their max potential and just plain old experience....I think it's totally acceptable for it to not be perfect.\n\nNow as far as pointless awesome AI shit that'll impress me, I've been patiently waiting for Amazon to give me the fucking Alexa experience everyone initially envisioned all those years ago. I understand you can build you own. I'm even proud to say I understand how to and am completely capable given the time, tools and materials....but I want a true plug and play commercial product. Something that has a commercial and that Google can use to blast ads at me lol",
