    "body": ">The more powerful an AI is, the more powerful the computers needed to power it, and computers are expensive.\n\nNeither part of this sentence is necessarily true. We're already seeing AI companies using distillation techniques to create smaller models that reproduce the behaviour of larger models, so there's no way of saying how large an AGI model necessarily has to be. The first one will be huge, I'm sure, not once we have AGI there will still be competition to create more efficient models, except of course it will primarily be AGI developing those models. And computers are also becoming more powerful and cheaper. \n\nThe real limit is probably the cost of energy, and I can't see how that would be a greater cost than that of employing humans, what with their need for education, sleep, food, healthcare, and pensions.",
