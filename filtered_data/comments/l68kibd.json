    "body": "# We are building a hackable health tracker with AI Insights\n\nHello ChatGPT community!\n\nMy name is Jakub and I am the co-founder of Aidlab, a small hardware startup from Poland, where our mission is to deliver accurate wearables for health enthusiasts, data scientists, and researchers.\n\nI hope you don\u2019t mind if I share a few words with you about our newest project:\u00a0[Aidlab 2](https://www.aidlab.com/aidlab-2).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbvihzt6sf3d1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a820a1d58ae00cb187a061df8916ea2f33d53c2b\n\nAidlab 2 was created to bridge the gap between simple fitness trackers and advanced medical devices. We aimed to make a personal tracker (Aidlab learns the user\u2019s behavior to provide meaningful feedback) and to create something open to tinkerers. We\u2019ve developed a\u00a0[well-documented SDK](https://www.aidlab.com/developer)\u00a0with examples for data enthusiasts.\n\nHere are some strengths that we and our community see in Aidlab\n\n* It learns. We\u2019ve used some neat machine-learning techniques and basic heuristics to create a truly\u00a0**personal assistant**. For example, Aidlab 2 will suggest a short walk, but only if it understands you and your daily routine.\n* It\u2019s open to developers. At local geek meetings and Hackerspaces people are creating crazy things using the first version of Aidlab. Some guy created a\u00a0[Flappy Birds clone](http://www.aidlab.com/market/breathing-sky), where the bird was controlled by the signal from the lungs.\n* It\u2019s open for researchers. Aidlab was widely used as a\u00a0[learning platform](https://www.aidlab.com/research)\u00a0- for those who want to learn the basics of data science, IoT, and mobile development.\n* Aidlab 2 is built on top of high-accuracy sensors. For almost three years, we have been testing the best biosensors on the market to provide reliable readings.\n* Aidlab 2 supports custom, internal add-ons to optimize the vital tracking process. For example, you can decide to focus on sleep, fitness, or health tracking only. This could give you higher reading accuracy, as normally we are limited by Bluetooth bandwidth.\n\nWhat Aidlab 2 tracks:\n\n* ECG.\n* Galvanic Skin Response.\n* Respiration (Chest movements).\n* Location (GNSS).\n* Motion detection.\n* Skin temperature.\n* Sound (**only**\u00a0for detecting snoring, noise pollution, and coughing - we\u00a0**do not**\u00a0send sound to the cloud).\n* Steps, pulse, HRV, automatic bodyweight reps detection, activity (timeline), recovery, calories, sleep parameters, and more\u2026\n\nHere, I am looking for an opportunity to spread the word about Aidlab 2, receive honest feedback, and some love.",
