    "body": "I think the other commenter is just saying that they write all of their notes for a day in a single text document, and then they just copy and paste all of the text, nothing fancy. As far as I know, none of the notes apps you listed have a way of interfacing with chatgpt, so you'd have to manually copy them all into a single file in whichever formatting/order you want it to be read, and then just copy and paste the entirety into chatgpt, although if those apps have a way to export notes as txt files (not sure if they do), there's probably a program out there that could automatically consolidate them into a single file.\n\n If you seriously think chatgpt could help you here though, it's probably worth moving all your old notes into a file and keeping only one file for all your notes, or maybe one file on every device you write notes on and then a \"master\" file somewhere that has them all combined. Just keep in mind that chatgpt can only process a certain amount of information before it loses accuracy and forgets details, so depending on just how much you want processed at once, you might have to do some research on how chatgpt's token limits work and then run your text through openai's tokenizer to be sure that it won't lose or misunderstand bits of information.",
