    "body": "This sounds like something a 25yo with no life experience would say. Why is it that I pay $20/mo for chatgpt pro and it still can\u2019t do ANY of my annoying tasks. It can\u2019t open my computer, it can\u2019t login to my programs and take notes, talk to multiple people on multiple teams about many parallel projects going on. It is incredibly far away from doing any of this, or doing any of this for people that trust it to do any of this. I am so sick of loser fear porn about stuff that isn\u2019t even close. Introverts are TERRIBLE at meetings and communicating. Yeah, there are probably a lot of introverts that don\u2019t know how to deal with people that can be replaced because so often they are the bottlenecks and causes of project breakdowns. But that isn\u2019t saying much. They fill the intelligence/ research gaps. The only lesson here, learn to be a freaking human!",
