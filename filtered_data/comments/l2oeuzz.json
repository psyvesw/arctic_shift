    "body": "Mathematical models have already had a huge impact on society. I would recommend reading \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction\u201d as it highlights events (College rankings, Online advertising, etc..) that have been occurring since last half of 20th century that has drastically changed how we humans behave and operate.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of pros and cons regarding these highly capable models and it should always be a nuanced conversation as you can\u2019t deny the benefits of \u201cAI\u201d for research/engineering/science but need to be aware of the ethics and regulations that should be in place to ensure all of humanity (not just the upper class) benefits.\n\nGoing into a conversation like this with only one mindset (pro-AI or anti-AI) and then being highly biased towards \u201ca side\u201d just shows me that the individual has no idea what they are talking about.",
