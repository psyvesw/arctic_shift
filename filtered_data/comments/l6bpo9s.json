    "body": "yeah.\n\nby definition a tool like chatgpt lets you act outside the boundaries of your knowledge without knowing you've done so, which is super dangerous. and it also sucks and lies all the time. I've used it to generate MySQL results that looked right, but were wrong. \"it looks right, but is wrong\" is not always easy to detect, especially when you're using a chaotic tool to convince yourself you don't actually need to understand anything yourself.\n\ncalculators are deterministic tools. you can learn to use them in a consistent way that produces consistent results. you give them absolute inputs and get identical outputs. none of those things are true of LLMs.\n\nask ChatGPT to tell you the lyrics to Rasputina's \"The New Zero.\" it'll make something up. tell it it's done so and it'll apologize and do it again. tell it again and it'll do it again, again. code is not magically different from lyrics. the thing has no idea when it's wrong, even when you're telling it so. I hope you'd give up your calculator if it acted that way.",
