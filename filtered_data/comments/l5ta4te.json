    "body": "I messed around with by asking what's the best way I could get it to give an assessment of a project of mine, a personal exercise to learn a new tech stack to which it said to provide the repo link.\n\n\nTo my surprise it returned a pretty accurate summation of the project, I asked it more detailed questions and opinions on alternate design principles I could use and it provided compelling answers, I was impressed.\n\n\nOne suggestion it gave that caught my attention was that there were places were the code was more verbose than necessary, I asked for an example and I thought to implement the suggested change but when I went to the file it didn't match the code it said could be improved.\n\n\nI ran a few more tests asking it to print a function from a specific file and it kept giving what I think are close guesses based on the stack and function name but they didn't match the actual project code.\n\n\nI asked it if it could see the code to which it replied that it could not directly, I tested this in several ways but same result.\n\n\nSo I don't understand how it could give the accurate initial assessment without directly seeing the code.\u00a0\n\n\nEither way, I learned that AI is not straightforward when things go off the rails, it's not aware when it's wrong and it doesn't have the ability to doubt itself, because of this it seems to choose to maintain an appearance of correctness instead of considering changing course or consider alternatives.",
