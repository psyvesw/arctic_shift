    "body": "Okay this is so dumb, I have to respond lol. (and I'm finally on my pc and keyboard)\n\nFirst of all OpenAI has laid out EXACTLY with other News outlets on why they are doing it.\n\n1. GPT3,3.5,4 etc. ARE already trained on EVERY news article from the web to begin with. All GPT's are MASTERS in spewing propaganda, racism etc. from the getgo. The problem is not how to get it IN but how to get it OUT.\n\n2. Newspapers will sue them for having used their articles in the PAST for training without paying nor consent, so OpenAI is striking deals for that BUT also to be able to LINK relevant news to the user if they WANT IT. \n\n3. OpenAI's goal is to build AI for EVERYONE. Every culture, country, nation, people, political leaning - for humanity. They also are planning to tailor their AI's to fit a certain culture so it will give different kinds of answers for different kinds of cultures and users.\n\n4. Another part is that ChatGPT should provide sources for relevant generations, be it articles from the past or articles from the here and now. But to do that, they need those deals.\n\n5. Maybe some users want to decide from what news source they want ChatGPT to relate to.\n\nIf you seriously think that they are striking those deals now to finetune their AI's on rightwing propaganda, you are seriously ill-informed and should really really learn to do SOME research going beyond just reading a headline or a tweet and then get a dopamine rush for your outrage and virtue signal on the web.\n\nHere you have it. Don't believe me - GO FUCKING DO SOME RESEARCH FFS. You don't even have to move, just use google or hell, even ChatGPT and try to not always paint everything purely as black&white and understand that things in reality are nuanced and complex.",
