    "body": "There ain't no ChatGPT scool yet. Even if there was, it'd be overpriced and probably a scam. I'd use the tool itself and get creative with it, ask questions, learn new stuff with it. Lots of good stuff on YouTube on it. Take advantage of the AI tools while they're relatively cheap and they get cluttered with ads like Google.\n\nFor example, my goal is to create some digital products with it. Simple how-to guide things with it. Then I can try to market it and sell it, since those are my strengths. And if I'm selling those and an employer sees I'm being innovative and curious, maybe I'll network with the right people.\n\nAnother thing I've done is use it to build excel tools. In an instant, I was able to find a very complex formula (by my standards) and create something that would have taken months had I fiddle farted with the dumbass Google SEO articles and BS \"courses\" online.\n\nWill it work? Slim chance. Will I learn something new? Absolutely. \n\nI was born in '89 and I'm in same boat as you, just learning after the dang thing took my job. Maybe someone here has better answers than I.",
