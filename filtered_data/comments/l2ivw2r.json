    "body": "What stuff?\n\nThat there are hundreds of psychology, medical and criminal studies showing evidence that a number of males who had been honosexually molested, groomed or raped in their earlier parts of life, had trauma and more often than not have inclinations to become gay or bisexual?\n\nThis is just a part of a very large and complex matter of course. Contrary to what a flock of libleft zealots who will swoop on my comment in a minute to flame / downvote may think, I am approaching this matter with sensitivity, compassion and understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nWhat I pointed out above should neither be generalised to \"explain\" the entire spectrum of choices or situations for gay orientation, nor to be misinterpreted as lack of empathy for victims of any kind of violence or molestation, not only sexual.\n\nI am trying to make a point that for a number of gay people, their orientation is a result of past homosexual experiences. It would not be sensitive to call that a \"transmission\" of course. But equally so, in this context, what the OP generated wit AI and posted here can be seen as hearltess trivialisation of the matter I pointed out in my comment.",
