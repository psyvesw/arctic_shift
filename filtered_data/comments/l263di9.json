    "body": "If you are an academic you will know how frustrating and stupid AI detectors are. Being forced to use simple words just to avoid AI detection in a masters or PhD level is annoying and makes you lose the meaning of many important concepts that cannot be dumbed down. It's an insult to your intellect and academia in general to be flagged as AI just because you used complex language and vocabulary.\n\nThis issue has only become more known in the recent past because of the emergence of AI that can write full papers but it's been there for a long time in the form of stupid plagiarism checkers. It is simply impossible for every single individual on the planet to craft unique sentences that have never been written before especially since the vast majority of what happens in education is literally the recycling of existing knowledge.",
