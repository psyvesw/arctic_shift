    "body": "except there are tons of simple practical jobs that AI cannot do.  Imagine if GPT was able to reliably manage customer service calls.  that would be game changing.  \n\nOr with self driving cars.  It was obvious the whole self driving tesla thing was a hollow promise from the start.  The biggest value in self driving will be full highway self driving for semi trucks.  you would be able to either have end of route drivers meet the trucks near the destinations to do the last few miles through cities, or have drivers living on trucks but essentially are just working a few hours at a time for pickups or drop offs, and lounging in the sleeper cabin the rest of the time so there are no mileage or time limits per day.  This is far more valuable than personal vehicle self driving and far simpler as it would be restricted to just major highways, but of course that hasn't even happened.",
