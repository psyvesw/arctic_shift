    "body": ">You don't think that internal to your brain's functions there are specific elements that do specific tasks. That's literally how the brain works.\n\nI don't see entirely how this matters to the discussion at hand? I argued that chatGPT lacks the ability to retain newly acquired information without another intelligent being (a human) quite literally changing it by pushing an update, not that it lacks a subdivision of tasks to its cognition (if we can even call what it does cognition in the first place, which is notoriously hard to define). \n\n>There are lots of people with head trauma who can't learn new things.\n\nUnless those people are literally comatose or braindead then this is simply not true. Sure, certain head traumas can impede certain specific types of learning, but the brain is always learning even subconsciously... No injury except actual braindeath/coma impedes learning in general.",
