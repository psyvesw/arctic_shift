    "body": "Look I cannot speak for everyone. My own experience as a chatgpt+ power user is that while it is a good assistant, you have to get really good at operating it if you want good results or at least not damaging results. I do not trust anything this tools spits out without testing it 5 times. Of course people also make mistakes but I believe that you can estimate if a person is good at their job at have at least some trust in what they're doing.\nMy point is AI is great improvement at assisting, but you should not let it perform relevant tasks without a rigorous controll mechanism.",
