    "body": "I think one of the most difficult hurdles is well executed personalization. Most of the complaints I see relate, one way or another, to the AI not behaving as the user wanted. Not necessarily not as *any* user would want, but the specific user. Now of course you can therefore counteract this by making the AI personalized but this is exceptionally hard to get right.\n\nCurrently it works like this: I tell the AI I want it to keep me motivated and get my work done, support me as I go. We start, all going well. I say I don't want to continue and the AI ***personalizes*** further and agrees we should stop.\n\nThis is what makes it so difficult, I know what I want in the long term but the AI reacts primarily in the short-term. If we can bridge that gap while still retaining flexibility necessary for specific tasks, then a lot of the other complaints will just fade into background noise. Figuring out how to know when to push back and when not to is something that is extremely valuable and key to learning and growth.",
