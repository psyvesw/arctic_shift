    "body": "  I feel like the availability of AI should just raise the bar all around for what should be expected. AI should be to everything what calculators are to math; a tool that frees us to focus our time and energy do things and learn elsewhere- a tool thats free's us to take on bigger tasks. The logic I am using here is that the real world is already adapting to the integration of AI. If we don't integrate AI and teach its use throughout the course of a child's schooling, there's going to be a gap be between what they were taught is valuable and what was is actually valuable in the real world. The knowledge we left school with already wasn't that much of a valuable commodity, that little bit of intelligence that allows us critically think and stitch information together was all that was protecting a majority of jobs from complete automation. That extra bit just isn't enough anymore. The standards have raised. The industries of the world and the people they employ are going to use AI to their advantage, we aren't helping anyone if don't do the same in schools or teach kids AI and it's utilization.",
