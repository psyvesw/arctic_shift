    "body": "I'm not the guy you're replying to but I'll take a stab at this for you:\n\nSome things I've noticed:\n\n  \nWriters' strikes happening all over because of AI-assistance in script writing which I believe has been actually used in places - Actually, freelance writing I believe is the same situation\n\nArtists losing their collective shit because of AI art and the implications that brings - See anywhere artists gather\n\nUndercurrent of dread for a lot of College / University students doing subjects like Comp Sci, seeing how easily AI can write code\n\nThat's just three industries / careers / hobbies that are massively impacted - There are going to be more for sure if you take a look.\n\nAnd for a more direct answer to your question - \"show me ONE example of someone using ChatGPT to do ANYTHING that would justify the \"people should be going crazy\" claims made by the OP.\"\n\n  \nHonestly, just take a look at what's happening with Deepfakes - Yes, this is of course a negative thing but it showcases the potential for disruption / chaos. What do you think will happen when there's a widespread ability to create videos of anyone you want, saying whatever you want, in a voice that is pretty-much indistinguishable from their own? \n\nElections are coming up all over the world, people already believe anything they see on the internet. And deepfakes are but outcome of what AI can do nowadays. I'd suggest that anyone who isn't feeling nervous or excited about the future of AI really isn't paying close enough attention.",
