    "body": "The output mentioning the Golden Gate Bridge is probably actually from [Golden Gate Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude), Anthropic's recent demo which inserts mentions of the Golden Gate Bridge into everything. Lots of people posted samples from it, Google's crap picked up on those posts as input & started regurgitating them. It's a rather interesting demo from Anthropic and clearly shows that their monosemantic feature extraction was correct. \n\nOf course making a LLM obsessed with a bridge isn't going to provide good results for other tasks, but is funny enough to cause lots of news & discussions, and all the news about it means other AIs will train on people's posts showing its output.",
