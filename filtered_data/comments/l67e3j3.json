    "body": "Study some basic neuroscience and youll realize that AI is nothing like a human brain. The brain is complex with structure. Neural nets lack structure completely. They just take in data and draw associations. They can\u2019t contextualize it. If you really want a human like AI, you need a cerebellum, an amygdala, a default mode network, a prefrontal cortex, a hippocampus, an autonomic and sympathetic nervous system etc. And with all of these neural structures comes the ability to distinguish and process, in a human way, the data it receives. \n\nAnd frankly, no one should ever build an AI with these structures because with these in built structures come pain, fear, and trauma. \n\nAI is helpful to humanity because it has the capacity to process data that we can\u2019t. For example, it can figure out animal languages, protein folding, and vaccine creation. What it can\u2019t do is figure out many things at once. LLM\u2019s are good at many tasks because language is good at approximating human communication, not because it\u2019s actually learning anything or good at any task other than language prediction. \n\nAI should never be an attempt to recreate us, because humans are full of contradictions and violence and pain and hurtful things.",
