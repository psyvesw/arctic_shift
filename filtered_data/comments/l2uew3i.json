    "body": "I\u2019ve spent my working career as an analyst and a translator. As such, I\u2019ve done a lot of writing, sometimes to convey rather complex ideas. Getting ideas written out always involves predicting the next word, and then the next word, and the next, and the next. You get the  idea. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works. \n\nI start with a vague  idea of what I want to say, the concept I want to convey. Since I have a boss or a customer, that concept is often given to me by someone else. It might be an instruction. It might be a question. Call it a prompt. \n\nIn response to that prompt, I start putting out words. I don\u2019t know in detail what I\u2019m going to write until I actually start writing. As I write \u2014 and this post is no exception \u2014 I find myself predicting the next word. It just kind of pops into my head. \n\nWhere do those words come from? My memory holds knowledge about a variety of subjects, and the bits and pieces of that knowledge have words associated with them. Or perhaps the words are the knowledge. Call that my knowledge base. \n\nHow do I predict the next word? I have no idea. My brain is a black box. \n\nThe only thing wrong with the statement, \u201cChatGPT just predicts the next word\u201d Is the word \u201cjust.\u201d The act of predicting the next word is not a trivial exercise.",
