    "body": "For a more serious answer - it's a valid point of view, especially since they clearly didn't get permission to use Scarlett Johannsen's voice. I assume OpenAI likes the free advertising they're getting from the comparisons to Her. I wonder how she feels about it, though. (If she sued, it would just be more free advertising.)\n\nWith that said, the demo showed you can ask it to speak in a different tone of voice and it will. You can probably add a Custom Instruction for \"speak in a professional tone.\"\n\nThey also showed businesses using it for customer service and video conferences - those use cases will obviously need different voices and a different speaking style than what we've seen so far.",
