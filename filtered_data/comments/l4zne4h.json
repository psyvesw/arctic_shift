And that AI voices will likewise converge on the most desirable. And lastly, that the convergence of those two voices along with unconscious bias might result in an outcome which is predictively like the voice considered plagiarised. The title of the paper will probably be 'all female AI chatbots reasonably will evolve to always sound flirty like Scarlett Johansson'.\n\nThe human goes for the ideal which gains them most Community reverence. The AI goes for the ideal which gains them most community reverence. They meet at a Voice which probably has predictable properties. Flirtatious is not an unusual one to expect.\n\nSee also. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513801000666\n\nhttps://manoa.hawaii.edu/exploringourfluidearth/biological/what-alive/evolution-natural-selection",
