    "body": "OpenAI/Google/Elevenlabs/etc are not going to open up access to their system to millions of gamers. Not cheaply, anyway. Bethsoft would have to build and train their own neural network just for the game, as well as text-to-speech capabilities. And they'd have to somehow package the whole thing with the game code. Or they'd have to implement some sort of always-online connection to their API. This would of course constantly crash, rendering the whole thing a complete shit-show. \n\nBut you can be sure they're working on it, even as we speak. \n\nI agree, though. If they get it working properly, the damn thing would be freakin' *magical*. Talk about a completely immersive world! Imagine sitting down to discuss Tamriel history with Urag gro-Shub. But he slowly gets drunk and begins slurring his orcish speech.",
