    "body": "If you're sad because you won't be able to build a Language Model, don't worry about it. They are so expensive to train and fine-tune that nobody except a few hundred people at the big tech firms will even ever be a part of that process. You can still learn to fine-tune a model, and build really useful tools utilizing the APIs from foundation models.\n\nDon't be so hard on yourself. As many have pointed out, you're looking at it wrong. \n\nFeels like you may be at that difficult point where you know enough to be dangerous. Keep learning and you'll eventually understand that you can indeed do a lot. Having coding skills puts you ahead of the curve.",
