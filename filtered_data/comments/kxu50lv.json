    "body": ">Employers typically don\u2018t pay for education, sleep or food. Often they don\u2018t even pay healthcare or pensions.\n\nThey do indirectly, yes. The cost of labour is in the form of wages, and those wages have to cover basic necessities such as food. As for healthcare, if you don't want your workforce to drop dead, you're paying for that too - either explicitly as an employer, or in the form of taxes, or the employee pays for it, in which case it's again covered by wages. Same with pensions - *someone's* paying for the food people eat after they're no longer able to work, and if it's not the employer, it's the tax-payer, which means it ultimately comes out of the wages the employer has to pay. Same with education, or at least the cost of bringing up children to the age where they can work. If it's paid by the parents, it comes out of wages. If it's paid by the government, it comes out of taxes, which come out of wages.\n\n>I also don\u2018t see AI companies giving their technology away for free. They want to recoup material, R&D, marketing etc. plus a profit margin.\n\nOf course not. Slightly less than the combined wages of your entire workforce is not \"for free\".\n\n>AI robots are competing with someone in Bangladesh who works for $1.40 per hour (which is still a lot compared to even extremer cases).\n\nSure, and AI will only drive that number down further. But eventually it will be cheaper than a human can get by on. And don't worry, that doesn't mean AI companies won't make a profit - remember, you need to multiply that $1.40 by the number of hours worked *and* the number of workers.",
