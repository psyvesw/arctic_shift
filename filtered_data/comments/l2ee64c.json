    "body": "obligatory ChatGPT reply:\n\n> While I understand the frustrations you've expressed regarding the performance degradation of GPT in coding tasks, it's important to consider several factors that might explain the observed behavior rather than a decline in the model's capabilities.\n\n> \n\n> Firstly, the transition from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 involved significant changes aimed at improving safety and alignment with user intentions. These changes may inadvertently affect how the model handles complex coding tasks, especially when the instructions involve multiple layers of context or specific requirements. This isn't necessarily a \"decay\" of capabilities but a recalibration towards safer and more reliable outputs across a broader range of tasks.\n\n> \n\n> Secondly, it's worth noting that the model does not \"learn\" from individual user feedback directly. Instead, improvements are made through updates in the training process by OpenAI, using a diverse dataset that aims to generalize well across all users. The idea that GPT is training on \"GPT trash from around the internet\" is a misunderstanding of how training data is curated and utilized.\n\n> \n\n> Moreover, the issues you mentioned about forgetting to include specific variables or focusing too much on one part of the code might be influenced by the inherent limitations of the model's context window. This means that in some cases, the model might lose track of earlier parts of the conversation or code, which can result in errors or oversight.\n\n> \n\n> It's beneficial for users experiencing consistent issues to provide detailed feedback to OpenAI, as this data can help improve future versions of the model. Meanwhile, using clear, concise prompts and providing as much context as necessary within the same interaction can help mitigate some of the issues.\n\n> \n\n> I encourage you to share examples of the errors or problems you've encountered. This could provide more insight into whether these are isolated issues or part of a broader pattern that needs attention. Also, exploring how different settings or versions (like the latest updates or different configurations) impact performance might reveal solutions or workarounds that could improve your experience.",
