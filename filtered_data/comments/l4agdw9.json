    "body": "Don't use AI to write your entire paper, please. And you're saying even a whole thesis? MA or Bachelor's? You know what, doesn't matter. If you're in an academic program you need to learn how to do the writing yourself, it's not that difficult, AI can assist you on how as well.\n\n\nAsk it to review some paragraphs you write, you can also ask it to help you with an outline. An outline isn't exactly a part of your finished work, but it helps you write the work, like a skeleton that holds things together. If you have a decent, clear outline, the rest is just filling it in. ChatGpt does help with the outline part, you can give it your topic and ask how it would go about writing an academic essay or article or something with this, ask it to detail each chapter's structure. Then you can modify it to your needs, follow it like a guide and write your paper",
