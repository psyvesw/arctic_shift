    "body": "All you need is a particularly large set of GPUs with a bunch of large language models running concurrently, all set up in a clever way where any mistakes one instance makes can be caught and corrected by all the others.\n\nJust look at AutoGPT. A whole bunch of large language models, all prompted in such a way where they each contribute a tiny fraction of the final result, but intelligence emerges through consensus. With a more traditional program which controls their outputs, a memory system, a workspace\u2026 this is all that\u2019s needed for current amalgamations to develop entire video-games on their own.\n\nThere was a study where researchers took a jar of jelly-beans and asked a few thousand people to look at the jar, think about, _really_ think about it, and then make their best guess as to roughly how many jelly-beans are in that jar. Most answers were very far off, but the average of their guesses? That was almost exactly on-the-dot. Collective intelligence. Works for anything that has at least a _reasonable_ shot at getting the answer somewhat right.\n\nYou could probably build some sort of system capable of itself building an extremely advanced neural network, designed, tested and finished all by A.I with only modern ChatGPT 4o. It would take an _extreme_ amount of computational power, but still. Who knows where we\u2019ll be with even just the next version? When it gets even cheaper and/or faster?\n\nI have no doubt we are truly nearing the point (if not already past it), where a group of dedicated researchers with a massive super-farm of servers and tons of money to burn could genuinely build an ASI. Or, rather, the system which incrementally builds upon itself and tests itself before upgrading itself bit-by-bit over how ever long we wish to leave it running for.",
