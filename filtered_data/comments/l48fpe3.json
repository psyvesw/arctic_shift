    "body": "This is the main interest for me. I enjoy seeing my friends but they aren't all interested in the same things I am. There are facebook groups and forums for hobbies, and sure there's a 'real' person at the other end but I'm still typing into my computer and still at the whims of another person for where the conversation is steered.  With AI I can ask a very specific niche question about whatever I'm interested in and have a proper back-and-forth discussion about it, without needing to wander off-topic. Last week we were talking about bridge building during the Roman empire, this week we were talking about the war time service of the returned crew members of Shackleton's antarctic expedition. As someone who loves to hyperfocus on topics it's like having an equally enthusiastic research buddy available 24/7 to engage with.",
