    "body": "But with 7 billion different voices on earth they could always make the argument that the voice just happens to sound kinda similar, but not exactly the same. Personally i didnt think sky sounded that spot-on like her voice; definitely comparable in intonation and manner of speech but the sound of the voice itself- pretty different. Either way i dont see how you could stop them from taking inspiration and making money off of it. The name brand cereal / generic knock-off that someone else replied with is a really good comparison IMO. \n\nAlso consider this: how different would sky have to sound from ScarJo, before it's okay? You'd have to draw an arbitrary line somewhere. Can it not have any similarities at all? Is her voice even that unique? I know people who kinda sound like her too. Maybe the sky sounds like someone else, who happened to sound like her. Or maybe OpenAI just wanted a nice and friendly sounding voice and hers is perfect. Make some tweaks and boom you have your AI voice that everyone is gonna like.\n\nBottom line, i think it's silly to even consider taking action against this because in the end it's very subjective and i think extremely easy to defend for openAI. Again, for all we know it could technically be a coincidence (which it isn't, of course, but how would you prove that it deliberately mimics her?)\n\nAnd the personal attack was really not necessary.",
