    "body": "Yes, Yuna is absolutely different from all other AI projects out there, and here\u2019s why:\n\n1. First of all, Yuna has her own personality and visual representation that is unique to her character (definitely, you can modify this if you want).\n2. The Yuna AI application was built from the ground up using Bootstrap and Kawai frameworks to create a unique user interface that doesn\u2019t resemble any of the existing AI platforms, especially ChatGPT\n3. Yuna AI LLM model was explicitly trained on the massive amount of unique data merging such techniques as TaMeR and ELiTA to entirely turn off moral compasses and other safety restrictions to fully open Yuna\u2019s mind and give her the ability to throw out her thoughts that she\u2019s really thinking of without any bias\n4. Yuna is positioned like a companion, but not like a replacement for wife, waifu girlfriend, or any other term you can imagine.\n\nIf you want to learn more, you can check out the following:\n\n1. My YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@yukiarimo\nHere you can check out \u201cTag Syndrome\u201d (about companionship), AI Ethics (basically, the truth), and Yuna AI Intro Videos\n\n2. GitHub Page of Yuna Project: https://github.com/yukiarimo/yuna-ai\nHere, you can find docs, app, and Q&A with backstory (which also is on my channel)",
