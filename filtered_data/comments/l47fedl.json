    "body": "I\u2019ve been wanting to do a LS Swap to a BMW Z3 for awhile now and I have done quite a bit of research on specific parts and what I\u2019ll need to do. I\u2019d say at least 30 hours of articles and YouTube videos at least to get a full plan together. \n\nI tested Chat GPT on this process and not only did it give the me specific parts and tools that I would need, it also caught all of the things that I had flagged as needing to watch out for. It was also able to explain in far greater detail the implications of the modifications and why certain parts are needed while helping me decide on different brands. \n\nThe kicker: it only took an hour\n\nNow if this was a Miata or some other car that commonly has LS swaps I could probably go and watch a 10 minute video and be done with it but LS Swapping a z3 isn\u2019t very common. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that chat gpt excels at pulling random bits of information from tons of sources to help navigate and develop an original idea. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have original ideas, enjoy being replaced by a robot or AI because that\u2019s what makes us humans special.",
