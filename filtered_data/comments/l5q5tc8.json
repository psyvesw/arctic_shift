    "body": "I\u2019m a high school teacher who also privately tutors on the side for like $100 an hour. It\u2019s always been a nice side gig because essentially these families will pay me that much to hop on zoom and do the same thing that I already did 5 times earlier that day. However, with these LLMs, I know this side gig MAY become obsolete in a few years. Why the hell would these families pay me $400 a month when they could just pay $20 a month for way more than 4 hours of tutoring?\n\nThe answer is: the students themselves don\u2019t know how to extract the most out of chatbots. Self teaching and self tutoring requires a great deal of metacognition: being in tune with what you know, what you don\u2019t know, and what you need to know. These students just aren\u2019t that great at knowing how to ask the right questions and end up just asking for answers instead of really learning the material. They could be trained, but it takes time.\n\nCompare that to an experienced tutor or better yet a teacher who has knowledge about the exact scope of the course and what the common pitfalls to look for. Someone whose expertise lies in nudging students just enough to get them going without caving into telling them the answer. Someone who knows how far the student needs to go before things go beyond the scope of the class or level.\n\nMy opinion about AI tutoring is the same as AI anything: it\u2019s really good at being a \u201cB-\u201c quality assistant, but in its current state has a long way to go to compete with \u201cA-\u201c and above human experts.",
