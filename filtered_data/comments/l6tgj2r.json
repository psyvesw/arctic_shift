    "body": "Question after question after question, and remain practical:  Real money comes from true ideas, which arise from actual human needs. AI won't give you an idea, but using AI you can research and develop  new or already known ideas, until your mind by itself comes up with a truly New Idea.\n\nThen AI can guide you on how you make it into a product, service or a course, but so far, all the courses about using AI I've seen haven't taught me anything I hadn't figure our myself with the help of free AI itself, and I've come to more effective conclusions and ideas just by experimenting with AI without paying anyone else.\n\nSo, unless you only know how to use AI like an MS Word or XL, don't waste money in courses that teach you what you can learn by yourself. Just dive deep into a subject, and then dive even deeper, and use AI to study and learn. Your brain will do the rest, if you give it enough rest and proper food (and remember the main food of the brain is oxygen, so meditation is a practice that in the long run, can help you be more creative).\n\nThe smallest and simplest ideas are the ones that usually achieve great breakthroughs.",
