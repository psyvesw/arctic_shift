    "body": ">There's nothing cheaper than a living organism for basic duties. Nature has been computing its optimisation algo since the beginning.\n\nSort of, but nature optimises for survival, not economic cost. Human brains are very energy efficient, but humans need a lot more than a steady stream of calories to be productive. In terms of energy, a typical adult male uses less than 0.1 W, so if we can make AI that's 1000 times less efficient, it will be cheaper to run than a lightbulb. This is not what makes labour expensive - it's all the other stuff, like clothes, sleep, education, housing, pensions.\n\n>(like lifting a 50-tons rock or answering in under 10 seconds in 50 different languages).\n\nOr doing any other task on a faster or larger scale than humans can. This doesn't exclude any profession that I'm aware of, with the possible exception of professions like arts or care where human labour will be inherently valued *because* it's human.\n\n>At the current stage of cognitive AI development, i.e. the LLM//transformers revolution, we are no other vehicle to go further than a tool that scales up quasi-linearly with the amount of resources we feed it. The sole energy bill of compiling GPT 4 iinm was around $100milion. The next mark will emerge with more WOW! shit, but precisely because it will have been fed with either more machine or human compute (RLHF).\n\nOk, but I'm explicitly *not* talking about the current stage of AI development. You might well be right that LLMs won't deliver AGI, but in that case LLMs won't be the last form of AI. This argument is no more valid than if 20 years ago someone said AI will never be able to do anything other than recognise images, because that's all you get by scaling up CNNs, the most capable model at that time.",
