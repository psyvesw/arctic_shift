    "body": "Nice find ...however you have failed to completely understand what you have in front of you and your sensationalist posts is incorrect in a number of ways ...i will attempted to rectify readers.\n\n1. Bittensor is a network. It consists of 32 (currently) subnets each with their own speciality and intelligence/value creation. Corcel is not made by Bittensor.\n\n2. Corcel provides API access to reliable subnets on the Bittensor network and subsidises the onboarding of developers to the network to bootstrap growth through token grants. \n\n3. Corcel also creates front end user apps to showcase the power of the API across multiple subnets.\n\n4. Corcel Chat has the ability to use a number of different models, but the most popular is GPT4.5 Turbo - because who doesn't want GPT for free! You can also opt to use Claude3 also for free and Gemini ..or if you are more inclined, open source alternatives like Mixtral.\n\n5. The leveraging of centralised API keys is the work for subnet 18 (Cortex.t) which provides incentivisation arbitrage for those able to provide inference at scale with enterprise grade keys. It is highly profitable and competitive.\n\n6. The power of subnet 18 is that not only can you access all these models for free, but the validation process facilitates the creation of very valuable synthetic data and through a collaboration with Nous Research who run subnet 6, it is being used to train a Nous model on the Bittensor network. All of that data is publicly available and open source to anyone.\n\n7. Corcel chat is not lying to you or hallucinating, ..it is much more than a GPT wrapper, but if you want it to 'just' be a GPT wrapper it can be. It also generates images though, ...not with Dall-e but with an open source model called Proteus which is on subnet 19 (Vision).\n\n  \nBasically you have only scratched the service if what is being built on Bittensor - and with a fair launch, no pre-mine and no VC lockups etc ... you couldn't get a less 'scam-coin' if you tried.\n\n  \nI am more than happy to get into this in more details but i think I have addressed the main points.",
