    "body": "If course it will be. Do you know of any government that's generous and has it's populations best interests at heart? None of them do (except Scandinavia - they're pretty ethical).\n\nEvery government will give people only enough to keep themselves in power. If they give you more money then that is because their cronies in business still need to sell stuff. So all the money they give you will ultimately get funnelled back to their buddies. \n\nPersonally I think governments should be the first things to be automated (after middle management gets wiped out). All politicians do is yap and make policy. A well trained AI would be a much fairer and less corrupt government. Actually, a shit AI would arguably be better than most politicians in most countries, let's be honest.",
