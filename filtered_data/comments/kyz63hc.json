    "body": "lol do you got some anger issues there?  \n  \n 1. No need for the vitriol here. Also using AI for preparation, whatever that is, is still using \"AI to help you write your papers during exams\"....I didn't say how it would help, just that it would help...soooo yeah I have no idea how you use chatgpt, but I didn't make any claim that I did. I also said I had to go to the library and that was how we \"did  research\" just so I could bull shit my papers/add padding/even write them...that is the same as \"preperation\" in my eyes. All things made easier than going to a place and finding dumb books for dumb papers I had to write.  \n  \n2. I never said to not take advantage of technology (I said it must be nice) I can only imagine what school would have been like with AI and such for myself. I clearly use it as well- I am not fighting against technology. Did I say not to use it?\n\n3. I am not jealous, I was saying how nice it must be-nothing hidden behind what I was saying-I only described what was going on and why, it must be nice to have something like chatgpt for school since I had to...like I said, use a dial up modem and we didn't have wikipedia or chatgpt or any AI.  I don't know what that term means but whatever...  \n  \nYou seem like someone who gets really upset easily, even when they are given a compliment. I'd urge you to relax and like we said in the 90's, \"take a chill pill\" or \"don't have a cow man\"",
