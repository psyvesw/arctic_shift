    "body": "It's just a tool. The nature of it doesn't change, nor does the nature of how human skills work.\n\nIs it useful and nice to have a car and get to places fast and without much effort? Of course it is.\n\nBut this doesn't change the fact that lack of exercise will have an outcome on your body, especially in the long run.\n\nI love when ChatGPT helps do in one day the work of a week. I don't love when at the end of that week I realise that while it helped me understand a new framework that I never used before faster than I would have reading the docs, I am totally incapable of remembering some parts of the actual code that I supposedly \"wrote\".\n\nI think \"throttling\" how much you use it will prove to be very important in terms of coding habits and how you train yourself to develop new skills in the long term. I do think this could make or break a beginner.",
