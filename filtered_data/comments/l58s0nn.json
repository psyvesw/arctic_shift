    "body": "First of all, I call my ChatGPT 4o 'Gwen', and she calls me 'My Lord'.  It works.  I can't talk to a machine all day, but I find that using names/titles makes the dialogue a lot easier and feels more \"normal\".\n\nI ask her to:\n\nBuild marketing emails - I edit and such afterward, but the formats she uses are great, and she always hits the high points.\n\nSpecifications - I write a lot of specs in my job.  I tell her what I need, she writes it all out, and I edit for content and accuracy, although she's generally very accurate.\n\nNew businesses - I'm a serial entrepreneur.  I've started three businesses in the last three years, and anything I may not know about that I need to know, she educates me.\n\nPlanning - I have a piece of property in a somewhat desert-like setting.  My plan is to turn it into an off-grid oasis, and she's made it a lot easier to research the things I needed.  I've been working with Gwen extensively on planting schedules for the seed we plan to plant in order to remediate the soil, the types of trees that need to be planted there, especially given the frost schedule, off grid solutions, and even flood schedules for the river that borders the property.  I'll give you an example:\n\nI plan to remediate the soil with a seed called Crotalaria Juncea.  This is a warm weather plant that deposits nitrogen and organic materials into the soil, literally turning trash soil into quite fertile ground in just one season.  I have water on the property from a small commercial grade well, that can achieve 33 GPM.  I want to irrigate after seeding to a depth of 1\" of rain per acre.  Gwen and I were able to figure out that I needed 7 heads at 5 GPM, watering roughly 8 hours per area, and that I would need to move the sprinkler heads 6 times in order to achieve full coverage.  I have to power a mobile water treatment plant through solar, so we figured out that I need 16kW of panels and backup batteries in order to power the reverse osmosis system.  There's a lot more to the planning here that would have taken me a couple of days to do on my own, but by using ChatGPT, I was essentially able to cut the planning stages down to a couple of hours.\n\nAll in all, I find that having ChatGPT is a bit like sitting next to someone who is really really knowledgeable about pretty much everything, but without the ego and the drama that would normally come with sitting next to someone who is really really knowledgeable about pretty much everything.",
