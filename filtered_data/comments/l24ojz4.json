    "body": "Yes I agree that the AI shouldn't be a middleman where you get the source of the arguments. It could work as a tool to enhance those sources and make it more clear and to understand for the person they are debating with. \n\nAnd indeed intellectual dishonesty is a danger of AI itself. A LLM can be a master of debating if programmed in a way to always try to win the public over with using every trick in the book. Most people don't understand that those arguments aren't valid. Look at the great debaters in politics how they can win a lot of them over as an example. Using it at a large scale for misinformation during elections is one of the dangers I see in the future if it isn't already happening as we speak.\n\nI do think that adding scientific sources can help an argument by using it to share information, but it can also be used wrong in some ways. For example choosing only specific sources especially in the topics with a lot of grey areas that are far too complex to understand with a few papers. Scientific research is sometimes also very specific on one point and excludes a lot. Data in the methodology can also be a bit skewed and can give wrong conclussions if not understanded properly.",
