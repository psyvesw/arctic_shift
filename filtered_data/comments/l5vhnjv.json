    "body": "Honestly, glad I stuck with my gut and didn't fund 1st gen tech. Also, haven't used one - because no one bought one \ud83e\udd23 - so I can't say it performs as bad as reported first hand. \n\nOverall, I have no allegiances to tech companies - including OpenAI. I have more concerns over a monopolistic AI future than a startup flopping on a product. OpenAI and Google's multi-modals are impressive but leading us to a very narrow corpus of combined intelligence. Hopefully we course correct before it's too late having learned something in the last 29 years.\n\nTL;DR: I was wrong and will take the L without shame. \n\nThanks for asking!",
