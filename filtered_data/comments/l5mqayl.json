    "body": "People thought the sewing machine, combustion engine, and spreadsheets would take away jobs etc.  Really they just enabled a new way of doing things that was better, faster, more efficient, knowledge work. A spreadsheet used to take a day to calculate on paper.  It's one of the few \"low code\" solutions that actually works.  Take these away and most businesses would fail. \n\nLLMs are probabilistic machines.  They give convincing answers all the time that are plain wrong. \n\nAs a programmer, I use GitHub copilot and bing, openai GPT, perplexity.ai, and other tools to help solve programming problems. My job is all about encoding human needs in logical deterministic ways. It's hard. And the machine models are helpful but more often than not, they lack creativity, they can't solve original problems, they can't give complex answers that combine more than 2 ideas, and they get insistent and stuck.  They frequently give answers that look right even with a quick read through 10 lines of code, but that are just wrong.  Programming students can solve their homework with LLMs because the problems are well formed, basic, and targeted and understood patterns.  They will have quite a shock when they graduate if they aren't careful. \n\nKent Beck, a leader in the field, said that using GPT to program is like programming in a dark room with chopsticks and oven mitts on.\n\nJust because it appears to be intelligent doesn't mean it really is.",
