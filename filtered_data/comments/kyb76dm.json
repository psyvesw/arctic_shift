    "body": "Totally agree. Yesterday I was working on an abstract for a paper I'm writing. The limit is 250 words, and my abstract was 267 words. I didn't feel like spending the time cutting 17 words, so I asked ChatGPT 4.0 to rewrite it to be between 240-250 words. It then rewrote the whole thing, cutting a ton from it, leaving just 157 words. But it told me it was 243 words. I told it to make a numbered list of every word, which came to 157. I asked it how many words were in the list, and it said 243. \n\nIf I want to be gaslit like this and pay a lot of money for it, I'll go back to my ex-wife",
