    "body": "Remember that everything that's generally considered a high IQ concept too complicated for a lay person to understand, from AI to Computer Science to Mathematics is almost always just word salad that abstracts away some relatively benign concept that, in aggregate, is psychologically overwhelming.\n\nThe original purpose of these terms' / symbols' invention are generally to save space / time when writing or conveying information between experts.\n\nThe problem is that midwits who bruteforced their Masters or PhDs run around using them as an opportunity to show off. Or worse, use the terms as placeholders in a sort of cognitive hand-waive that convinces themselves that they understand more than they do.\n\nNobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman famously had a reported IQ of 125 (~1.5 SDs above the mean), and yet had profound contributions in physics.\n\n\nYou just need to check your ego at the door and set aside time for some dedicated, structured study to catch up.",
