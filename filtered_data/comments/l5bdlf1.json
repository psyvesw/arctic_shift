    "body": "Nothing too different than a lot of things mentioned here. Hmmm well I guess that's not entirely true. I'm just so used to using it. There is an app on iPhone and now on the PC called be my eyes. It has several different functions one of which is a feature that brings up a camera. When you snap the picture it send it to chatgpt and gives you a description of the image within a couple seconds. You then have a field below the description of the image where you can ask further information/description be provided about the picture. \nFor example I was attending a gala yesterday evening and I took several pictures of the blazer I was wearing and was asking which colour shirt would go best with it. And then I took a picture of several different shirts and it did give me a good idea of which one I should wear with the blazer.\nPretty simple stuff for the average person but if you put yourself in our shoes, not having access to this information your whole life and then having access to it feels like a kind of magic. Also simply taking a picture of a piece of paper and having it read to you is quite amazing. You could scan and OCR before but I would argue that this is better because it cuts out the uncertainty when scanning graphs or things with columns because it will simply summarize them, the grass that is and if there are Pages with multiple columns it will read those properly.\nAs for the text to speech engine, I am currently using Alex on the iPhone. But I mostly prefer eloquence which is on the iPhone as well but is a lower quality Version of eloquence then i use on the PC with jaws for windows",
