    "body": "I forget the name for the effect but have you heard about how when an expert sees the media cover what the expert knows about, they are often shocked how badly the media get things wrong, the way they make up bullshit and take quotes out of context etc?\n\nThen that exact same expert goes back to watching the rest of that exact same mainstream media, thinking all the OTHER stories are true, researched and trustworthy...\n\nIn short, we all experience or even spout gibberish when outside of our 'training data'.\n\nBut how do we actually think and reason? By comparing things to our own training data, ie our lived experience, education and what we've seen in movies etc. That's why we're all so unique, for as well as unique genetics we have unique data.\n\nAI can get things totally wrong, and so can humans, and we both frequently do. Now, with all that said, I'm curious why you think an AI cannot understand things?\n\nWhat would be the difference between appearing to understand, and understanding? Appearing to reason, and actual reasoning?\n\nI find with AI you can easily catch it out with trick questions, but at the same time if you give it chances to figure out where it went wrong, it will.\n\nThis thing can't handle long text so I'll post an example in another reply...",
