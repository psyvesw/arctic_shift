    "body": "I just had to go through an appeal process at my school because my professor said GPT Zero told him my essay was 100% AI. I supplied my revision history through google docs and he said it still doesn\u2019t prove I didn\u2019t use it. He gave me a zero and this essay was so many points I would have failed the class and lost my scholarship. Luckily the appeal process found with my revision history they can\u2019t claim I used AI and they made him grade my paper correctly. \n\nBut this whole process basically caused a two week long instead panic attack for me as I\u2019ve never failed a class or been accused of cheating.",
