    "body": "Well, the difference is that one is top-down sexism, the other is bottom-up. You see the same thing with skin color: it\u2019s currently more generally accepted to make fun of white people than it is of black people. A double standard that looks unequal on paper - and it is, but only if you strip away all cultural and contemporary context.\n\nOf course that doesn\u2019t excuse actual, harmful sexism or discrimination towards anyone. The goal should be to eliminate harmful discrimination altogether. But we live in an imperfect world where  sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination and hatred are rampant and when it occurs it\u2019s important to keep in mind these factors and that it is all part of society\u2019s growing pains.\n\nAll that said though, I believe these changes should come naturally from within, only encouraged and never enforced. Especially not by a fucking LLM.",
