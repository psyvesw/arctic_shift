    "body": "You're just trying to hinge your whole paragraph on the fact that NLP is useful.  Yeah, no shit, without it most of this hype would be inaccessible but without NLP machine leaning is still the same linear algebra and predictions based on regressions, etc. As a consumer you're just seeing this box magically spit out something but you have little understanding of the technology of how it is done so then you extrapolate to everything else.  It's just 1st generation hype. This has been expected for at least a decade, and no just because the number of tasks where AI can be somewhat useful has expanded the general paradigm hasn't really changed all that much, nor have the predictions from those who work with it in earnest. \n\nCongrats on teach your kids to rely on a machine for everything. You found use-case that google and other has been training the population to do for decades. BTW none of what you said about GPT 4 is at odds with the actual description of how machine learning works. It's not underhyped at all. We're still in the middle of the first wave of adoption and various overhype it creates like you using it to teach your kids.",
