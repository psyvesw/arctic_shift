    "body": "It depends. ChatGPT is inherently a crowdsourced project, so no they don\u2019t have something better than that. \n\nRecently ChatGPT was in the news due to privacy concerns and the U.S government told employees and contractors not to use ChatGPT.\n\nIn all likelihood, what you refer to as the government is not really the government. There are several defense contractors who build military and police tech. Yes they use AI. Raytheon, for example has it\u2019s own Supercomputer. The NSA is probably the only government agency that actually hires and deploys AI. The FBI, CIA, etc just buy the tech from someone and then that someone is forbidden to sell it for some amount of years, if at all. Usually, this is done through non-disclosure and non-compete agreements that make it so the employees can never actually go out and build that tech. There are a ton of hacking incidents where projects were leaked. That\u2019s how people found out that Intel chips have hardware backdoors.\n\n As for AI in government, it\u2019s very extensive. From drones to datamining. They all have it and it\u2019s basically derived from academic papers. But the power is not the algorithms, it\u2019s the hardware. Hence why China doesn\u2019t get to have NVIDEA chips. \n\nIf the \u201cgovernment\u201d were to get GPT\u2019s, they would have higher token limits, higher uptimes, no resource constraints, and hybrid cloud computing",
