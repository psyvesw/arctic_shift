    "body": "I see what you mean. Even though Human disconnection happened before AI, I see how AI could be seen as a kind of extreme extension of capitalist alienation though. It will be used (and already is used) to compensate for the lack of human interactions. The root cause isn't AI, the root cause is the way our society is built. AI is just an extension of that society. I think there's hope though. AI could paradoxically help us reconnect with one another though, by reducing the amount of work we have to do for instance and giving us more free time to spend together, by making the world safer and more prone to trusting each other. Of course this is in an ideal world. I think people are aware that they're talking to a machine and that it's just a \"social bandage\". I think people will still crave the real thing.",
