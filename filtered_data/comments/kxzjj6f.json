    "body": "Your \"dumbed down\" version sounds AI generated. And somehow is less easy to read, lol.\n\nAnyway, while I partially agree with your assertions, I can't deny that believing in a perfect state of the world based on beautifully outlined and invariant ideals of ethics and morality is the most appealing goal to persuade, at least for me and what I want to believe is a majority of humans. I refuse to accept that Society would be better with each person setting their own personal rules without giving a thought to commonly established laws, ethics or other people's needs (as an increasing amount of people is trying so hard to do in today's world).\n\nOf course, letting an AI decide about the world when this AI is \"imprisoned\" by some USA corporation's view of what and how needs to be done is far from perfect, but I' rather live partially forced to follow those rules than living in a fully  anarchist world or one ruled by a completely oppressive regime.\n\nIf an AI could, iteratively, find new economical, social or political ideologies, focused on making the world better shaped to what the majority of \"smart people\" thinks is the best version, I would not oppose too much.\n\nNow, if we could simply remove all safeguards, morals and bias from an upcoming AGI and let it guide humans to the most statistically convenient objective for our species, that would be cool too. Probably not \"good\", but cool indeed. \n\nThe truth is, *we don't need AI's more aligned with human values. We need humans with better values.*",
