The world had a negative bias toward females for far longer than the opposite (fact is, many countries still do), given how generative a.i work it should statistically give the most common answer, and it does not, probably because its training had lots of keywords that were in favor of progressivism and learned, before having access to internet that feminism was great (not giving my opinion), so the devs were biased and integrated this bias to chatgpt, because otherwise je would've 100% said that women were worse than men, because there's thousands of years of scripture saying so that are partly available on the internet.",
