    "body": "As an ESOL teacher I started using it to help me prepare materials (3.5 - I'm too bady paid to pay for 4 or 5). However it has very many limitations, some related to lack of knowledge about language (lots of inaccuracies around tenses etc), and many related to its inability to do something that neurotypical humans do effortlessly: guess what you might already know, and then not say that thing because it's obvious. Chat GPT says everything, it labours every point to death. It is also florid, sentimental, and as a default has a completely USA capitalistic worldview. \n\nAs a result a lot of its output is different from what real humans in my community say, and its output (for example if I ask it to write a dialogue)  has to be heavily edited and culled. I also find that the same prompt, which once worked to curb some of these tendencies, might not work reliably as Chat GPT evolves, so I do a lot of fiddling around with prompts to get what I want, and sometimes have to give up. \n\nCurrently I am getting more natural and helpful output from Google Gemini as far as language goes.",
