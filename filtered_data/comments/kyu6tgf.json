    "body": "Also that is a terrible comparison, no offense. chess has a finite amount of moves and rules. Ai has no rules. \n\nThe process of making music isn't about pressing a button. It's a feeling. It's making mistakes that become happy mistakes. It's testing out instruments and combining ideas, re-processing and chaining instruments. Nuance. Detail. Hardware. Ai can't do shit yet except make generic bullshit melodies based off of crunched data. And guess what, as a an artist, it's the last thing you'd want: no control over your sound.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again. There are no shortcuts to creating timeless music, movies, etc, learn something about the history and technique, hone your process, and stop looking for shortcuts.",
