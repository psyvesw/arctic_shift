    "body": "It's important to remember that most LLMs specifically answer stuff that they at some point somehow have been trained with. For example, if ChatGPT saw someone use let/ instead of let*, then it might use let/.\n\nSimilarly, if someone made a math error online, ChatGPT would still use it. ChatGPT isn't *actually* calculating 2048295 + 38375937. It's using data that it has been trained with. This is also why it can't answer long form mathematical problems because the chances are near impossible that it would get a similar question online. There is an exception, of course:\n\nIf you let ChatGPT do steps like we do, it can find the solution to larger problems because it isn't being asked a very specific problem anymore: it's being asked much more common ones.",
