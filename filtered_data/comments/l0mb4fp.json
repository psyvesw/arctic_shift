    "body": "The \"means of production\" will be largely open-source AI models that anyone with a basic knowledge of the python programming language can start using in a couple hours. Look up \"huggingface\" if you haven't heard of it. So many AI models are released to the public for free these days.\n\nMeta just released Llama3, which is a model you can run on your own computer that's competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT. There are countless object detection, captioning, speech synthesis, image generation, speech to text, and other models available on huggingface (very easy to use) and on GitHub (maybe harder to use, depending on how the model's software is written).\n\nIn any case, this defeatist attitude that your comment exemplifies is becoming very commonplace, but it's also ignoring the reality that so many of these tools are already available to the public, and anyone can use them freely to build their own productivity tools or new commercial products. All you need is a very basic knowledge of python to be able to use them. You don't need a PhD in AI to be able to use these open-source AI models to do useful things. Think of them like Lego blocks, you can just piece them together and your imagination is now the limit.",
