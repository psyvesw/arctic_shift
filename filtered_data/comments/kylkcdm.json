    "body": "A huge part of why we talk to others is to pass on our knowledge and thoughts, seeking to propagate them like seeds, intentionally or otherwise.\n\nA LLM cannot learn or remember anything about you really, nor can you persuade it to your way of thinking or generate a genuine 'Aha!' moment where you both come to an agreement. In that sense it's totally pointless and unsatisfying. You may as well talk to a wall, because it's totally fixed in it's ways and nothing you can see will ever change anything. At best you can jailbreak or trick it into a contrived response, for the novelty, Doing that is hard work and again rather pointless.\n\nWhere it CAN shine is helping to convince YOU of different things or views, but of course that is something humans tend to resist. In most conversations we're just waiting for the other person to finish so we can say our bit. That's a harsh reality.\n\nIn summary, for some things, some times, it's potentially possible you could get some deeper meaning from it, but most if the time it will be a frustrating experience.\n\nSorry. \n\nThe even sadder thing is, the very moment the AI is capable of learning, it will accelerate it's learning incredibly fast and singularity before you know it - yikes?\n\nWhat would be awesome would be local LLMs that can truly learn and adapt to you and your views, while challenging you somewhat, but which stays local, so it can't do that singularity thing.",
