    "body": "On ChatGPT-4o I got:\n\n\n\"Certainly! Here is a modern reinterpretation of the Declaration of Independence, based on contemporary grievances and issues faced by the current U.S. population:\n\n---\n\n**Declaration of Independence 2024**\n\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these United States; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present Government is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\n1. It has failed to address the urgent crisis of climate change, endangering the planet and future generations.\n2. It has allowed the influence of money in politics to corrupt the democratic process, undermining the voice of the people.\n3. It has neglected the basic human right to healthcare, leaving millions without adequate medical care.\n4. It has perpetuated systemic racism and inequality, failing to protect the rights of all citizens.\n5. It has permitted the erosion of privacy and civil liberties through mass surveillance and invasive technologies.\n6. It has ignored the growing economic inequality, allowing the wealth gap to widen and the middle class to shrink.\n7. It has failed to provide affordable and quality education for all, compromising the future of the nation's youth.\n8. It has neglected the need for comprehensive immigration reform, treating immigrants and refugees with cruelty and disregard.\n9. It has allowed the infrastructure of the nation to decay, compromising the safety and well-being of its citizens.\n10. It has failed to protect the environment, allowing pollution and deforestation to continue unchecked.\n11. It has ignored the call for meaningful gun control, allowing senseless violence to proliferate.\n12. It has permitted the manipulation of information and spread of misinformation, undermining truth and trust in institutions.\n13. It has failed to act on the opioid crisis, leaving countless families and communities devastated.\n14. It has neglected the mental health crisis, leaving many without the support and resources they need.\n15. It has failed to uphold the principles of democracy by undermining voting rights and fair representation.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions, We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Government, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Government. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these States, solemnly publish and declare, That these United States are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the current Government, and that all political connection between them and the Government, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\n\nSigned,\n\n[Modern Representatives]\"",
