    "body": "Go to \"mygpts\", create a gpt.\n\nThen, I added a pdf of the novel to the knowledge base.\nIn the description I put:\n\na creative writing assistant and professional novel editor\n\nFor instructions I put:\n\nit should reference the final_draft.pdf document provided and offer critiques, edits, advice and guidance on the text. Specifically pointing out continuity errors, as well as places where things could be  better shown instead of told.\n\n\nThen as I'm editing,  I can ask questions about the text. \n\nIe: \"Hey, in chapter 2, the character Ben is wearing a jacket, what color and fabric was the jacket? \"\n\nNovelGPT will respond:  in chapter 2 the character Ben,  Steve's father,, wears a blueish gray denim jacket with a torn breast pocket and patches with biker gang insignias.\n\n\nWhich helps me in chapter 5 when my stoned ass forgot it was a denim jacket and I wrote it as leather. Catching the continuity error.\n\nThings like that.\n\nOr \"novelgpt, can you look over the pdf manuscript final_draft.pdf for open story lines and continuity errors...\"\n\nIt might reply: \"we never learn what happens to John in the past, but the \"incident,\" seems integral to his character, can we explore John's last more? \"\n\nShit like that.\n\nIt's not going to do the work for you entirely,  you won't get a rewritten manuscript, (tho, I think with python,  the api, and some clever prompting you could automate the whole process.)  But it does a great job galloping the plot and noticing holes...\n\nOr, sometimes I was writing it was 3am i was tired, so I'd tell, not show. NovelGPT can take a chapter and find the places where more showing is needed.\n\nGpt4 can do this also, but requires a little more set up and reinforcement prompting,  where the custom gpt stays on task.",
