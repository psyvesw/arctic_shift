The mainstream media, in collusion with the government, is trying to push their gun control agenda by using \u2018crisis actors\u2019 to play the roles of victims and grieving family members.\u201d\n\n\\-Generated with ChatGPT\n\nFor Sky News and Fox as well, removing all the staff just means bigger profits and no more risk of whistleblowers, or risk of their media talent going to the competition. Most of the stuff we know about Fox publicly, came out because former staff went public and current staff leaked it. \n\nAI generated doesn't improve the outcome for the public with regards to Newscorpse style \"news\", it makes it much worse.",
