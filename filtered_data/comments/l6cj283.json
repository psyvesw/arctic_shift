    "body": "i think you need disposable income to pay for various subscriptions, also a pretty good computer that can process everything, about the same as a really good gaming computer or crypto mining machine..\n\nthen you can experiment to learn freely.\n\nOf course all of that really isn't necessary if you know what you're doing. I'm sure there are several people who would say \"Well if you just have any computer, and you can use several gpt models freely you can use lots of AI tools easily.\"\n\nbut for my ideal, to be at the same forefront as others I'd need an adobe subscription, and/or a computer that can easily run image models. Also I'd probably need 2-3 ai subscriptions which all run at around $20 a month.\n\nanyways forgetting everything I just said the easiest way is probably go to chatgpt's discord server and read the entire history of most channels.",
