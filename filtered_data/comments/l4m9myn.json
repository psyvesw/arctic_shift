I can steal from my neighbor using my own body, I could hire a robber to do it on my behalf, or I can buy a robot to do it on my behalf.\n\nWho gets to decide what task is immoral and have that task banned by the government? I hope it won't be you, or people like you.\n\nAnyways, chatgpt isn't anywhere close to being able to operate a robot to perform some immoral or illegal task. There is no need to jump the gun and cry for government regulation at this point.\n\nWhy not wait until it becomes a problem?\n\nAgain, your entire point of view is copied and pasted from scifi books from the 60s.
