    "body": "Tried that already, didn't work. Has it ever worked for you?\n\nAlso, not sure what line of work you do, but not every piece of text for my job needs to be written by me, because as I mentioned before, there's a lot of bureaucracy and filler, and the content of the text is more important than my authorship. However, in the off chance the people financing projects use AI detectors as criteria internally, I'm trying to avoid those detectors. They don't mentioned that criteria anywhere in guidelines, but I've had plenty of teachers in college who used personal criteria that went unexplained, and I'm sure it happens to grant officers as well.\n\nSo I'm not cheating under any definition, I'm covering my ass against idiots, and I suggest you do too in your daily life.",
