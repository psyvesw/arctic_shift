    "body": "Exactly, it says he \u201cused AI\u201d to generate. It didn\u2019t say he \u201chappened to have some underage elf in a fantasy LoTR fan fiction generated art piece\u201d. They obviously know what this clown was asking the AI to create and probably using known hacks to bypass safety protocols. He\u2019s just not smart enough to realize that they keep a record of his activity and when he upgraded to feed his addiction or missed some step in his attempt to hide his identity\u2026 they got him. And thankfully there\u2019s one less sexual predator on the street. \nI once had a neighbor that worked at a local church. Everyone thought this guy was so awesome. He was a child psychologist and worked with under privileged youth to get them off the street and into college. He\u2019d been doing this for years\u2026 then one day the FBI shows up in full force and \u201cknock\u201d on his door. Turns out he was a groomer and had been using young men for around 16 years before he messed up and didn\u2019t send a file encrypted properly\u2026 so the FBI got enough info to get a warrant. Sadly, not one kid he molested had managed to get anyone to believe them until the church counselor messed up on his own. We have such a hard time believing people are this sick we focus on the unlikely scenario of the FBI accidentally flagging us for accidentally creating an underage hobbit or elf when the monsters they\u2019re looking for are typing shit in the AI dialog (or speaking to it) that would curdle a normal persons blood. Don\u2019t fool yourself. This creep didn\u2019t accidentally do anything! He\u2019s the real deal and hopefully this is a wake up call for everyone involved. Maybe GPT 4.o can help us navigate this. Because so far we\u2019re doing a so/so job of protecting our kids from these monsters.",
