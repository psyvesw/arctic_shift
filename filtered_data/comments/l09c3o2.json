    "body": "Gemini is largely the same way, but it seems a bit more nuanced than GPT on some things.  Here\u2019s its response to some of this:  \n\n\u201cYou're right, attractiveness can definitely influence how we initially perceive people.  There's a lot of research on the \u201cattractiveness halo effect,\" where we associate beauty with positive qualities [1].\n\nBut friendships are different. In close relationships, things like shared experiences and emotional connection become much more important. Studies show that over time, these deeper bonds tend to outweigh physical appearance [2].\n\nSo, while someone you find attractive might catch your eye at first, it's the things you have in common and the experiences you share that will make a lasting friendship.\u201d\n\nPretty privilege is a social phenomenon based on shallow interactions more so than it is something that occurs in long term / deep relationships.",
