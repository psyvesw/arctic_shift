    "body": "That's what I been thinking as well for a while. Lets take coding as an example. In my opinion coding is one of the most useful and best use cases for any LLM. Its not perfect and its cant do very complex workflows....yet, but undoubtedly it will get there. And I believe out of all possible white collar jobs out there, developers are at the highest risk. Lets take developers or any similar category of people job titles as a demographic. They represents an absolute huge part of the middle class office monkey jobs. And what's most importantly its the bastion of hope for most of those office monkeys in ability to climb that ladder and make a decent wage. Once you remove this you have just gutted a huge part of the middle class and the ability to socially uplift yourself. I think this will be devastating and will have vast economic and social ramifications. let alone the considerations for the millions of outsourced low wage developers from all over the world.",
