    "body": "It\u2019s not criminal. Part of being professors for universities is taking 6 months off every 2 years to do research for the university so it\u2019s in their nature to have research tendencies. And with everyone using AI in some way they know it\u2019s a thing. For instance in my masters course for my MBA my managerial accounting professor told us to use Chat GPT to create a business plan because it can do it better than any of us can. But the next semester a different professor told us not to use Chat GPT. What\u2019s the difference than using Google to find examples or templates for business plans then writing it or having it done more professionally? Chat GPT still needs alllll the details for every section of the business plan, it just makes it sound more professional and uses a good structure and outline. If you don\u2019t provide it enough detail it\u2019ll just ramble on about the subject without specifics and it\u2019s obvious someone used chat GPT and didn\u2019t do any of the work themselves. It blows my mind you think that\u2019s criminal. LMFAO \ud83d\ude02 I have 4 degrees, that being criminal never crossed my mind. I just used Chat GPT for the first time ever when the accounting professor told us to use it. I had to google how to use it. I did 3 of my degrees without ever using AI. Now I\u2019m upset I didn\u2019t use it before LOL And most students are stupid when using Chat GPT because it\u2019ll spit out the same results for everyone that copies and pastes the same question in it. They should be telling Chat GPT to re-write the answer it gives them like 4 different times so they know they\u2019ll be the only one that has the answer worded that way. \ud83d\ude44",
