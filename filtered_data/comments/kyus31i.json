    "body": "This is so wrong and ignorant. Observing a pattern is one thing, but grasping on to that pattern to dismiss some legitimate works done by honest people is ridiculous. As a person from a country that doesn't speak English as a first language, most people don't learn English from the \"movies\". There's still plenty of cases where people use formal, even archaic terms and sentence framings in their writing. To dismiss works by these people as AI is not only shortsighted, but also unfair and enitely indifferent to a significant chunk of the English speaking world.",
