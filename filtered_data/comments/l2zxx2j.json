    "body": "I absolutely expect that - you use an edge case with a famous, rich, and from my understanding, a very popular sports star of the time who was utilizing top legal talent with a lot of experts and you expect to generalize what you think will happen for most others. \n\nI personally don't see that happening; it's why rich people can generally buy justice - they're the only ones that can afford it. We've been using AI for years now in determining bail and we know one thing already - it's sets bail higher for minorities because of it's training data. \n\nJuries that just want to make a quick decision and get back to work so they can still pay their bills as inflation chips away at their earning power aren't going to take the time to learn the nuance of AI, training sets, NN topology, and how it all plays a role in the outcome of that model.\n\nIt's ripe for abuse and it allows the human operators, i.e., the state/prosecution to absolve themselves of blame",
