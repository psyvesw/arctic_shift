    "body": "Thank you very much for this context. This situation actually seems pretty straightforward to me. OpenAI has a paper trail that shows they think Scarlett Johansson's voice would be a valuable addition to the product. Altman also has at least heavily implied that Sky is meant to sound like her. I'm betting that if there were to be discovery, there would be emails that say, \"Make one of the AI voices sound a lot like that movie where the guy falls in love with the AI.\" This is most likely illegal. You can argue it shouldn't be but there's precedent here.\n\nThe bigger issue is that OpenAI is the kind of company that would rather ask for forgiveness than permission, at least in terms of copyright law.",
