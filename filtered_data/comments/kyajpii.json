    "body": "I use my GPT daily multiple times and have not seen anything get worse. Maybe it's the way I use it, maybe it's just worse for some and not others, or maybe people are just wrong. Perhaps it's a mix of all of them, I don't know. \n\nAs someone who grew up with a computer though and has always been fascinated by AI, I can definitely say that what we have now is amazing! \n\nI used to try out every single bit of AI software I could get my hands on, and the older models were obviously very limited. I specifically remember one that you had to teach everything from scratch, and would then just repeat everything you have given it. It is nothing like the actual answers we get now. \n\nI also remember when the highlight of \"AI\" was those little toy gadgets that would guess a word you had thought of in mind by only asking you a few questions. Now you can go on whole virtual escape rooms, write books, program, and do whatever else. \n\nPeople can obviously have the opinion that GPT got worse, but I haven't experienced it. If anything I noticed all the new upgrades we got, like how the knowledge was updated, we have TTS for free now on mobile, you can listen to the GPT's responses in the browser, and the memory function that is slowly rolling out for free as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are certain things I am still waiting for, but overall I definitely feel like things have gotten better, not worse.",
