    "body": "Yeah, I purchased a GPT+ subscription when the hype was especially strong but canceled it pretty soon after. I myself am working on some stuff that may be interesting, like First Language English igcse and A Level automatic essay checkers that suggest how you can actually improve your essay to get to the next level because the feedback I used to get from teachers at school was very much not useful. Most of these apps and tools rely on very simple prompts. Hence, users can just get the same results themselves from normal gpt. The essay checker will require some very long prompts to work given that it needs to follow the mark scheme (people won't be easily able to make the gpt do the same thing by themselves). From the stuff that already exists, I find v0 by vercel pretty impressive: it allows you to generate website components easily - very useful for dev",
