    "body": "My boy is almost 4, and he will sit and listen to books read to him for hours. I\u2019ve read 60+ magic treehouse books to him (some as many as 6 times) each book takes about an hour to an hour and half to read. Winnie Pooh, House and Pooh Corner, and of course the whole gamut of picture books. That said, the ability to generate a story on the fly in a pinch has proved to be very helpful. I also like that you can mashup characters from a variety of sources. My son gets excited about Winnie the Pooh meeting Jack and Annie, or Aerial the Little Mermaid meeting Bruders the Bear.\n\nImagination is probably 90% synthesis, really. And LLMs are very good at that. I think it\u2019s a fun exercise to play Chat GPT madlibs and watch the magic happen. My son even before 3 had an understanding that books come from an author who had to think up a story and write the words and that\u2019s partly because we let him be a part of that process. Engaging them in that process is empowering and fun.",
