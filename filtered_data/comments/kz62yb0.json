    "body": "Sure humans can copy bits of songs and paste them together, but that is wrong too. There have been plenty of lawsuits for stealing samples. Companies with AI are just much better at taking smaller samples and from a wider range of artists to cover up what they are doing.\n\nHow is human learning different to AI learning? Let's consider a child that has learned language in contrast to an AI. When you ask an AI how its day was, it's a meaningless made up response that does not represent anything real. When you ask a child, it means something, it conveys and shares an experience.\n\nA musician starts with life experiences and a desire to express something, they will hear different types of music and the bits that resonate with them inspire them to create something new that is meaningful to them, using the 'language' of what they have learned.\n\nIn this way its quite reasonable for an artist to say they consent to humans to learn how to make music from their work, but disallow a company with AI to imitate it through statistical trickery. **Artists should be allowed to have their own viewpoint and choose for themselves about what happens to their work.**",
