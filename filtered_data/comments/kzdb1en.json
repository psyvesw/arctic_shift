    "body": "It\u2019s so unfathomably **insane** to me that you\u2019re advocating for giving big tech companies MORE control of what information you have access to based on their *opinion* of what makes the world a \u201cshitty\u201d place to live. You want Google and Facebook to decide that for you? Are you out of your mind? \n\nWe need to learn a lesson from what happened to the internet? What the actual fuck are you talking about? The internet which was shaped and now dominated by the same tech companies that are on the forefront of LLM tech? \n\nYour response is so outlandish and shortsighted that I\u2019m 50/50 on whether it was written by an LLM. \n\nThis whole thread is shitting on this guy for trying to sell his dumb newsletter so he can pay rent, and in the same breath, you\u2019re all praising Google as some sort of savior of decency and arbiter of morality? What the actual fuck? You\u2019re all asking Google and other companies like them to decide what information you\u2019re allowed to access based on THEIR subjective principles? Do any of you even think before you say this shit? I literally can\u2019t wrap my head around how fucking insane this.",
