    "body": "I had one of my final papers for completing my BAS last year receive a zero because it was flagged as being AI generated, so I sent the following explanation to my professor and he changed my grade to a 100%. \n\n\u201cHello Professor,\n\nI have just reviewed my grade for the week 4 assignment, in which I was\ngiven a 0 because it was flagged as being partially AI generated. AI, as I\u2019m\nsure you are aware, is a powerful resource that is emerging in tremendous ways\nacross almost every industry, and not utilizing it as a powerful tool would be\ncounterproductive. That being said, I did use AI to aid me in proofreading and\nrevising my research paper, but I did not have AI write my paper, nor did the\nAI do the research to find credible sources to substantiate my paper, nor did\nAI determine where and how to use each of the cited sources and what part of\neach source document to use.\n\nSo, while I did utilize AI as a tool in writing the research assignment,\nmuch like I used to use Grammarly (without the added cost of a premium\nmembership), it was still I who ultimately did the work required to research\nand write about my topic. I am already very familiar with the subject, as it is\nsomething that I have been interested in and kept up with for some time now,\ndue to the risk associated with it being used by scammers to prey on\nunsuspecting individuals.\n\nRegardless of me already having adequate knowledge of the topic, not using\nAI as a resource during this period of explosion for the technology, which is\nin the process of revolutionizing the world much the same way the smartphone\ndid, is equivalent to when high school math teachers banned calculators from\nthe classroom, stating that we would never carry one around with us everywhere\nwe went. Yet, here we are, carrying literal computers in our pockets every day.\n\nIn conclusion, I would appreciate it if you would take my explanation into\nconsideration and update the grade for my assignment.\n\nSincerely\u201d",
