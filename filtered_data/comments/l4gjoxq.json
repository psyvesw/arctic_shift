    "body": "\u201cWhy? Are you planning to flood every post with more AI responses?\u201d\n\nYes, many subs allow it anyways like the learn math one. \n\n\u201cYou really need to stop answering people\u2019s questions if you don\u2019t know the answer\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer and neither do they, but you know who does? GPTo \ud83d\ude00 \n\n\n\u201cMany of your responses are often unnecessarily lengthy\u201d\n\nNope that\u2019s also wrong. The main point is usually told at the start and you can stop reading at that point. If you want more detail (most people do specially when asking for an explanation) then you can keep reading \n\n\n\u201csome are outright wrong\u201d\n\nTrue to a small extend using Opus, however now, since using GPTo, I have yet to get a single response saying I was wrong, only people thanking me.\n\n\u201cAnyway, why spend your time copy and pasting responses when you can better use your time?\u201d\n\nWhy is this not a good use of my time? People need help \ud83d\ude00",
