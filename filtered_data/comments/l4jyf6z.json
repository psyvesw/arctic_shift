    "body": "This has all the clich\u00e9s of a conspiracy theory. It\u2019s cutting edge tech, of course there are NDAs. But because everyone wants to know everything, they have to make up stories. Maybe there is something off, but if an NDA is unfair, they can be voided. I imagine a company who cares about their tech wouldn\u2019t put things in their NDA that would void it.  \n\nNDAs that are oppressive, overreaching in scope and seen as an attempt to protect irrelevant information can also meet challenges and be invalidated by courts. \n\nSo if it\u2019s whistleblowing without disclosing vital data, openAI would lose the case.  \n\nIt\u2019s funny that no one has thought that maybe they were rubbish at the job after the company expanded and new talent came in. Maybe OpenAI are just being fair, rather than being an Elon.  \n\nWho knows. Why does it even matter?",
