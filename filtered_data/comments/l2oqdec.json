    "body": "Upvote for Weapons of Math Destruction. Excellent book.\n\nI don't think being pro-/anti-AI is a bad thing, but this particular Doomer clearly has no idea what he's talking about. Or rather, he's pull shit out of his ass. He basically posits a world where AI is massively useful until it autonomously becomes actively destructive to human life. Isn't the point of AI that it can learn, that it adjusts to context? If so, then why is it eventually necessarily destructive to human life? Not getting the right initial conditions doesn't preclude correcting them as the AI learns.\n\nI didn't watch the whole thing, but the pro-AI folks didn't point that out from what I saw.\n\nIn short, this dude is like, \"What if...??\" and the pro-AI people are just sitting there taking it.",
