    "body": "Communicating with ignorant individuals is a trifle on its own. Some people just don\u2019t want to learn. Some people cannot even be bothered to modify their opinion when presented with facts.\n\nBest I could say is find out what AI detector your teacher is using. Then use something you know for sure is in most all LLMs training data. I know the Declaration of Independence, Shakespeare, and other famous writings score highly if not 100% on these so called \u2018AI detectors.\u2019 Once you confirm these writing score highly encourage your teacher to try them themselves. \n\nIf they seem confused why these famous texts clearly not written by AI score highly. Encourage them to research the issues behind \u2018AI detectors.\u2019 From personal experience I already know what the training data looks like. Old famous texts are royalty free so any LLM engineer would be a fool to not use them in their training data. Not to mention these LLMs (Large Language Models/AI) are entirely or mostly trained on human writings. This make it impossible to make a proper \u2018AI detector\u2019 due to the LLM is constantly getting better and better at mimicking human outputs.\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to sway your teacher with logic, go to their boss with your case. Personally to avoid conflict I would run all my essays through AI detection and if it scores highly I would run my essay through AI and prompt it to rewrite my essay in a way that avoids AI detection.\n\nAlternatively you could show her your rough drafts and research you used to write your essay. I don\u2019t usually suggest this because I have a bad habit of losing notes when I do research lol",
