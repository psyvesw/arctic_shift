    "body": "I think of this [Louis C.K. routine on air travel](https://youtu.be/D_Txjv30XDU?si=ssYMW5v6P8zmCzQR) whenever I hear people complain about AI.\n\nOf course AI isn't perfect. It has bugs, and doesn't always work as advertised. Sometimes updates nerf certain features, which can be frustrating.\n\nBut can we all just have a little perspective for a moment? Can we not enjoy the fact that we are probably witnessing the dawn of a truly incredible invention?\n\nLike, 10-15 years ago, people were talking about the Turing Test, like it was some amazing Holy Grail. We've blown past that so fast, so hard, it should be mind boggling.\n\nBut now, we're like, \"that super detailed, ultra high resolution image Midjourney made completely on its own, with like, two sentences of shitty promoting, gave a person in the background an extra finger.\" As if the user complaining was ever going to come even remotely close to doing something like this on their own.\n\nI'm not here to defend AI as perfect or infallible, it's obviously not. But anytime I see someone complaining that it's \"unusable,\" I immediately know they are either lazy, stupid, or a combination of the two. I use AI to do amazing things every day. If you can't, it's because you lack the wherewithal to think creatively about how to use this technology to solve your problems.",
