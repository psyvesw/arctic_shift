Another talked about this comedy where one guy gave a super drunk girl to another guy so he could lose his virginity.\n\nThis is valuable research but those are hard patterns for people to work through. I would have to really consider the professor before I submitted papers with either of those references. My university really defends academic freedom but I would still be risking my program.
