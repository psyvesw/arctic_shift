And that is an active choice you make to either hyper focus on the problem, or be solution focused.\n\nYour boss can change policy and say \"all IT tickets must be written on loose leaf and in crayon\". \n\nYou can bitch all day about how ridiculous the practice is and cause yourself stress.\n\nOr you can go out and buy a 600 pack of crayons and figure out how to supe up the process.\n\nEnd of day- it's your choice.\n\nGPT is perfectly capable for plenty of productive purposes, I literally use it every single day at my job. For employee reviews, remembering hot keys, assistance with trig, rephrasing emails. I get my money's worth easily every few days. \n\nThese excessive complaints posted every few minutes- because it can't read minds based on a single sentence prompt, or that it's too \"woke\" is infantile.",
