    "body": "A lot of my writing \"training\" was done during my PhD in science stuff.  So, super dense using fun adjectives and verbs with hours spent on a single sentence kind of stuff.  The kind of stuff AI spits out these days.  Basically, one of my skills was overturned overnight to the point that even I will use AI in technical writing, assuming I have several points i want to make it makes the writing process like 50% faster.  It still takes time, I'm not directly using anything AI spits out, but it throws you a bunch of good ideas that would otherwise just be you staring at the screen for a while writing and deleting sentence after sentence.  \n\nAt this point in my life I'm just expecting 'robots' to take all the jobs and we will retire into a dystopian wasteland of poverty.  Might as well use it while you can, before even your input is deemed unnecessary.",
