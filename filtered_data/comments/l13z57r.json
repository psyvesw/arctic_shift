I have not even uploaded data to the GPT yet so it's not even close to done and I can't share the link in it's current state until I know it's safe to use (it's currently not).\n\n4. The instructions I'm giving are mostly coding based having to do with AI axis of rotation, temperature, and orbital delineation. I can't give out these instructions and you would need to learn the coding language for me to even help you write your own.\n\n5. Instead of trying to carefully define what Dolly (DALLE-3) does, I let her do whatever she wants and focus on defining restraints instead, for example not allowing her to sexualize girls under the age of 20.",
