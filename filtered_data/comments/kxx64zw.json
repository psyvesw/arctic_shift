    "body": "Being a chat bot is its purpose, to be fair.\n\nYou seem to be inferring from what you were told that it's trying to just placate you by stringing things together that roughly look right with no care for the meaning, but we're past that. The stochastic parrot idea is already kind of out of fashion (it's a fast moving field).\n\nWhen confronted with a prompt, it predicts the most statistically likely sequence of text that follows, but that doesn't mean it's carelessly piecing things together. The trained model on which it operates means its statistically-inspired answers are valuable. There is truth to be found in statistics.\n\nIf you ask someone the capital of France, they'll almost certainly say Paris without looking it up. And if you ask them the capital of Turkey, there's a good chance they'll say Istanbul -- which is wrong. It's Ankara. \n\nWhy do people make this mistake? Because we also learn in a similarly pattern-based and statistical way, influenced by frequency and exposure. Istanbul is a far higher profile city, and so it's almost reflexive for many people to 'assume' it's the capital. This is basically the same way in which the AI makes mistakes too! However, it's less likely to make such fundamental mistakes because it's been trained on far larger quantities of data than a random human.\n\nAll of this is to say -- I don't think how it generates its responses is a particularly damaging criticism. In fact, it's incredibly impressive.",
