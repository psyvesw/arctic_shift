    "body": "Nah dude, you're good. The only painful part about AI is that there's a lot of theory that precedes it.\n\nYou need to start with basic arithmetic, linear algebra, calculus, statistics, etc. In other words, it has a LONG learning curve that has to be taken seriously, You won't learn it from YouTube or a crash course; you actually need to sit down and read many many books. For me, this process has taken around 10 years and I still have so much more to learn.\n\nIn fact, I've witnessed a lot of brilliant coworkers jump ships to management, consulting and finance. I do not think I'm any smarter than them. The only reason I'm still here 10 years later is because I was patient.",
