    "body": "When I was in college I was accused by a professor of handing in someone else's work for a psych paper. His reason for accusing me was because I rarely spoke up in class, and when I did speak up, I didn't speak the way I wrote. I hated his class and the way he taught, so no, I didn't speak up much. Anyway... I had to hand over my notes to prove that I wrote the paper. The dude even asked my other professors about me. He seemed too eager to have me fail the class.\n\nMy experience has nothing to do with ChatGPT, but my suggestion is that if you're going to hand in a writing assignment, try to keep any notes you have for it. If you don't think you're going to need notes, make some anyway so you have *something* to show if accused of cheating. With more people using AI, regardless of how it's used, there are probably going to be more and more people accused of cheating in the coming years.",
