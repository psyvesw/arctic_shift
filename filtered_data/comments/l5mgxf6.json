Must I keep going?\n\nBusinesses know about ChatGPT. Some even provide it to their workers. You know how many people use it? Little to none. Worse, those that do, don't know how to use it. You have millions of programs and devices that improve your productivity at work. But these don't completely replace you, someone still has to use it and know how to use it correctly. The people who will lose their jobs will be those who didn't adapt. Like the people who refused to adapt to printers, computers, and smartphones.\n\n\"Who doesn't know how to use ChatGPT?\". Many fucking people. Almost everyone I tell to start using it, don't seem the use for it even after showing them the uses.",
