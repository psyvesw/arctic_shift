    "body": "Here an average programmer is usually more right winged while average artist is more left wing. And I think I've heard more about universal income from artist, while many programmers would be complaining at it (as they'd often earn more therefore pay more taxes). So maybe it depends on a country.\n\n\nWhen it comes to art process, trust me it's often a nuisance too. Most of artists struggle making art, there's a plague of art block etc. It's just that they feel like they can't really say openly that they struggled or ppl will see it as a bad thing, question the artist why they're even making art in the 1st place. There's also overall a misconception that to make art u just gotta be talented and that's it. And it's still often seen as a \"kids play\" while coding is much more often seen as something very difficult. (Although many ppl struggling with their job hear/read \"just learn to code\" from random programmers like it'd be easy for everyone)\n\n\nOverall, if the AI building companies would invite ppl to upload their own art/photos to their system, clearly saying that it'd be used for training, I guarantee you, that many artist would be willing to help.\nBut no1 asked them. And that's one of the biggest problems.\n\n\nNow back to the universal income - the biggest problem is that it's not a thing and won't be in many places for a long time. That's why AI is so dangerous for many ppl. On top of that, AI was supposed to take care of the mundane work, so we can focus on our hobbies, do more creative things (art, music etc). Meanwhile now AI is taking those fun things leaving us with mundane labor work...\nAI is threatening the very essence of being a human. Taking away something, that was supposed to be the safe place for many. The last bastion of human expression.",
