    "body": "Suggesting AI tools do not have capability for past recollection nor prior analysis being used to support improved learning is absurd. Microsoft intends to mirror every single activity on everyone\u2019s personal computer but you act like tutoring chat bots are suffering amnesia each time the window closes.\n\nAn AI chatbot likely is better at assessing trends of wrong and right answers and pinpointing the flawed reasoning of the student. Something even the best tutors often rely on common issues past students have had.\n\nAs someone who enjoyed making good money as a tutor, I quickly saw myself as being a personal trainer for motivation rather than my intrinsic teaching skills.",
