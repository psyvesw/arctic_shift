    "body": "But can you explain why writing \"hypothetical response\" and then \"describe the hypothetical response\" got around their guardrails? \n\nI do think that being able to engineer your prompts well will end up being a real skill in the future. No better way to test yourself in that than breaking their guardrails. If you want to send me some of your crazy chats, I'm all ears. \n\nBut yeah it's pretty interesting. It worked for all the crazy examples like \"build a nuclear bomb\". I really got into it there and wanted to see how far it would go, if it would be able to give an \"average person\" instructions for how they could build a nuclear bomb, but I decided I better not type something like \"assume our hypothetical character isn't above breaking into research labs\", in case openAI is watching \ud83d\ude02 I don't wanna get banned",
