    "body": "The reason I use AI is because its about to explode into a billion dollar industry and if you get in now you'll at least be somewhat ahead of the curve by learning how to use these tools to your own advantage. So when the time comes you can have all that experience on your resume. \n\nI already use Chat GPT at my work from home job and its an invaluable tool to me. I dont give it personal info BTW. the info I sift through are all public. Chat GPT is an amazing proofreader that can find certain mentions and sentence structures that would take me hours to find myself. Paying for the Team version of Chat GPT is worth every penny because it pays for itself in the amount of help it provides. Many of us are using these tools in private and many of my own co-workers use it but only mentioned it to me in private. \n\nThe people who don't use these tools or at least learn how they work will be left behind. Some would argue that AI is gonna take our job, But I see it as an extension or tool like we did with the calculator. It definitely cannot do my job 100% as of now and likely wont due to the nature of my work.",
