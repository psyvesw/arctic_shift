    "body": "The AI Explained guy literally calls the paper genius in the video description. With this video, he suggests that this is some revolutionary technique that will give us general purpose robots soon. People in the comments, here and on YouTube say things like \"robots improving robots\" with their imagination going wild. My point all along, my goal posts, are that this paper is way overhyped. Yes I read the relevant bits, and I watched the AI explained video. The novelty lies in using llms to write the reward function and then get feedback about the performance to improve on the reward function. This is basically what any coding LLM based agent does. I am not saying it's a bad idea, but it only works for a couple of steps until it gets stuck and needs human intervention. So my point is that this an interesting idea, but in no way live up to the hype that the AI explained video generated.\n\n>Which makes outcomes and limitations of other things like humanoid robotics set for rapid advancement, because the development can be automated.\n\nThis is basically why this paper really triggers me. There will be no rapid advancement because of this technique. Some small part of the development process get some productivity increase (a few iterations on the reward function) but that is a small part of long and laborious process of building a robot and making it do something useful.",
