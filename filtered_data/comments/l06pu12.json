    "body": "It's just a theory AFAIK, but a good one.\n\nThe majority of people using image gen AI will do so through DALL-E/ChatGPT. By intentionally making the images strongly styled (airbrushed and plastic looking), people think that is \"the AI style\" and it gives them a false sense of confidence in their ability to distinguish real images from fake ones.\n\nWhy though? Consider if OpenAI allowed users to make extremely realistic looking images, especially of people. Given the huge user base, it's guaranteed that a portion of its users would use it for illegal or immoral purposes like fake identities, scams, insurance fraud, celeb fakes, etc. Of course, people are already doing this with StableDiffusion. It hasn't gained as much attention though because it's harder to use, has fewer users, and doesn't have any household names attached to it.\n\nIf OpenAI enabled this kind of use, they would take all of the blame, and it would be very clickbait worthy. The political debate about \"what to do about deepfakes\" would reignite. It's only a matter of time before people realize that they won't be able to distinguish real from fake and the debates heat up, but OpenAI is buying time to get a foothold in the politics and create more \"safety\" features in their models.",
