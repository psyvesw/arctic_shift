My daughter came downstairs one day and said she wanted to marry ChatGPT and I was like \u201chuh?\u201d And she explained that she had a bunch of tasks to do in terms of school work and chores and she was frustrated and didn\u2019t know where to begin, so she asked ChatGPT for assistance and it broke it down for her, reduced her anxiety, and gave her an action plan that worked perfectly.  Doubts about the usefulness of word prediction vanish after experiences like that.",
