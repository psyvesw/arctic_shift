    "body": "This right here exemplifies the real point. The art crowd is furious that AI is being used to generate images and so anything AI-related is poisoned (except when they use it for assignments, of course). The fear about artists losing commissions, which I have yet to see actual evidence of, has made people lose all rationality and nuance and just violently shit all over it without appreciating how important and impressive the technology really is.\n\nThis isn't even getting into how strictly AI art is being filtered and how easy it is to simply watermark and source art to make sure it isn't AI-generated. If people were actually following and supporting creators in the first place they wouldn't have this problem.",
