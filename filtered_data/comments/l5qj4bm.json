    "body": "Sure everything will \u201ccollapse\u201d if the only variable that change is AI replacing human labor. \n\nBut do you really think that\u2019s the only thing that will change? \n\nThe only thing that is needed to get an outcome where the economy even grows and the replaced workers still keep earning a good living is for AI companies and governments to come up with a broadly accepted metric for \u201cHuman (Labor) Power\u201d, the same way we came up with \u201chorse power\u201d back in the day. \n\n1 HP could equal one skilled worker being focused, working full time. \n\nAfter that you just calculate the average salaries in different fields and positions and just turn that into some type of scale. Then use that for an AI-Tax where companies pay for every AI-HP they use in the scale. \n\nWith time the scale system get phased out so 1 AI-HP is a fixed amount. \n\nAfter that the only thing that would be needed is to fine tune corporate taxes, VAT and find a incentives for those that are still needed in the workforce. \n\nI could personally see a solution where everyone gets a great base income and if you contribute to society by doing socially needed things like spending time with the elderly you get a \u201cgood samaritan\u201d bonus and if you work you get taxed 50%.\n\nThe reason for a 50/50 tax split is to have an acceptable balance that both sides can accept without creating a rift between the future employed and unemployed class. You and society benefits equally from your labor.",
