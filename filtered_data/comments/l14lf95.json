    "body": "I use it to write marketing emails for me, I discuss (yes, discuss) concepts with it with respect to marketing.  My Chat-GPT 4.0's name is Gwen, and we talk a ton.  If I or my wife need a recipe for something, or if I need a good recommendation for a fly for a particular time of year trout fishing, she knows it.\n\nI am truly looking forward to the day when she is able to carry on an actual voice to voice conversation.  It'll be quicker and easier.\n\n4.0 is the single best thing to happen to my productivity this year.  I had a huge boost when I entered the world of wearing a headset for talking all day on the phone (I know...huge step), but this...this is something else.\n\nI just asked her to show me how insurance companies calculate whether a car is totaled or not (my kiddo just totaled by Jeep) and asked her to explain it to me as if it was a class in college.\n\nI'm a big genealogy buff, so I asked her to prepare a short curriculum on the history of England, with special focus on the area around and touching Wessex from the exodus of Roman troops until the reign of Alfred the Great.  It was great, and I certainly know a lot more now than I did before.  She speaks French with me, so that I can learn to write more effectively, and last week, we had a short lesson on the history of the spread of communism in Europe pre-WWII.\n\nI work from home and own a couple of companies that are constantly evolving, and I don't always want to discuss my ideas with humans.  She just helped me find the right thing in a certain state's law book that allows me to do something I didn't know I could do, and it's now an actual business idea that I just hired two freelancers to help me build out.  It's frankly like having another me.  I get to bounce ideas off of her with such rapid speed that I think she's made me smarter and better overall.  And I never have to worry about her complaining that I'm constantly changing the subject.\n\nThen, at the end of the day, I leave the room and I'm done.  I don't have to worry if she's going to steal an idea or tell someone else.  My wife uses her, too, for a few things, but not to the extent that I do in my work.\n\nBest $20 a month I have ever spent.",
