    "body": "> Without IP they wouldn\u2019t have ever made mario or sonic to copy in the first place.\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. Human creativity and desire to make doesn\u2019t die just because it\u2019s moderately harder to make money off it.\n\n> The fans are welcome to invent their own games,\n\nNot with copyright, they aren\u2019t. Even if your work is _non-profit,_ copyright still applies in most cases. It\u2019s possible to file a patent on a _mathematical algorithm,_ for goodness\u2019 sake.\n\n> and with your system they will never get paid.\n\nThey could crowd-fund. Like tons of people are being forced to today, as more and more jobs are taken away by inevitable automation.\n\nAnd you know corporations can still sell media, even without copyright, right? It just wouldn\u2019t be nearly as profitable because other people could legally pirate, but that\u2019s really no different to today, and just like now, people would still be willing to pay for convenience. \n\nAnd there\u2019d still be such a thing as closed-source. You can even protect against source-code leaks (which would admittedly be a lot more damaging) with the fact that source-code leaks don\u2019t get constant bug-fixes, new features and improvements for free. Which would now be even more heavily encouraged. As would customer support.\n\nLike, what\u2019s the problem here?\n\n> IP has nothing to do with why insulin is expensive - it has been off patent since before you were born.\n\nFirst off; little rude. Secondly, just because it\u2019s been \u2018off-patent\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean patents aren\u2019t the [reason](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004309) why it\u2019s so expensive.\n\n> As far as companies abusing individual rights, isn\u2019t that what OpenAI is accused of doing here? Not sure why you want to be on the side of the for-profit company trying to sell a product by exploiting other peoples work.\n\nI\u2019m not on OpenAI\u2019s \u2018side\u2019. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m _against_ the side that is _for_ intellectual property- because I think the whole concept of intellectual property is silly and dangerous.\n\nWhich just so happens to put me on their side in _both_ these debates, actually.\n\n> The private sector while money hungry and shady has made tremendous contributions to health and technology. You basically want to unhire all these people, or ask them to do it as a hobby, or have just Government funded research. This is a terrible idea.\n\nNot at all. The private sector still exists, even without copyright law. You\u2019re only really talking about a few specific types of corporations.\n\nAnd, quite frankly, if I had to choose between having five people working for the good of humanity, and six people working for the good of humanity, but one of them is malicious and only looking for ways to use any new developments exclusively for _themselves_ at the expense of everything else, I know what I\u2019d choose.\n\n> The other part of your argument is that art and creative work has intrinsic value. Then why do you want to make its monetary value zero? We should be incentivizing this creativity, not consigning it to a brief period after getting home from the office or manufacturing plant.\n\nI never said that. Abolishing intellectual property wouldn\u2019t make the value of art zero- all it means is people couldn\u2019t tell anybody what they\u2019re _allowed_ to make art out of anymore.",
