    "body": "essentially yes it means you need a lot less accountants then before because 1 will do way more work with a calculator then 10 before without them them so only need that 1 accountant and generally speaking he will be the best one\n\nhe will have to it for cheaper as there wil 9 left to take his place. so 1 will still prosper and the others can retrain to a other job or try to get that single job no matter how you slice it the talent will prosper but the rest will drop down. \n\nin the end of day there will be saturation and it will drive wages down and a select few will succeed \n\nnow ai will be way more disruptive then calculator ever was because unlike the calc it will learn and get better with more training data. so you will need less and less people",
