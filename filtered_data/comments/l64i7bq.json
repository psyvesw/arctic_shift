    "body": "Depends if you have digital literacy skills. Which is a huge issue to resolve. Next, yes only a few hours/days to learn it, but if you had the advantage and privilege of using it already you have that advantage.\n\nWhile trying to figure out how best to use chat gpt AND follow things like conventions of writing or something like that, those with good prompt engineering skills would probably do better. Note: I don't like this argument since it leads to Malcolm Gladwell territory and correlation is not causation. I bring it up here since we will bring this argument to AI since we don't understand it enough yet and will try to find easy answers. \n\nLastly though there is something called third level digital divide. Goes a bit beyond just using chatgpt, but it's essentially referring to some have better real life opportunities and economic outcomes mostly due to geographical area (at the moment anyway). So people in those areas would have an advantage using these tools than others. Example, schools in areas with more money have more equipment (computers) and have better and easier access to learn opposed to a school with barely a computer lab.\n\nSo, it's more than just using chat gpt. There's a whole lot out there we need to figure out first.",
