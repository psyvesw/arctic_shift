    "body": "Not exactly? Like the effort I go through teaches me a lot. I may not \u201cremember it\u201d but it does help me with breaking things down and where to look at the code\u00a0\n\nIssue is I don\u2019t feel I have the time to learn something deeply lately \ud83d\ude05 maybe once I start with writing up the new system in the MERN stack I will learn things deeply.\u00a0\n\nAnother anecdote is I was tasked with creating some custom form that mimicked another embedded form. This form I did however relied one some custom for already. So as a workaround I needed to create navigable divs. Again gpt was super amazing in this regard because it connected the continue and back to the dots indicating where the user was. Then the lead helped me with a few minor things but gpt did the majority of it.\u00a0\n\nSo I think if you went to great lengths to make it work, something will stick. Funny how some cry about gpt but gpt is amazing. The dots thing, right, I initially did it long winded my. Gpt instead used some sort of array and increment and decrement algo instead. And also about implementing radio buttons that reset your input if you initially put an answer during yes but decide actually no",
