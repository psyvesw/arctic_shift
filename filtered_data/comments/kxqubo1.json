    "body": "Couldn't agree more, friend. I'm a writer and director too, and I genuinely think AI tools in their current form are supplemental to the creative process, especially research, etc. I don't understand why everyone wants them to replace the filmmaking process. Sure it's expensive, but expensive compared to what? Dune is the perfect example that an ENORMOUS return on investment is possible with a great story. It's just another story of people who don't want to do the work to learn how to tell a story or what goes into screenwriting, wanting to jump the line. Hopefully it's quickly seen that this is not a replacement for MAKING movies, just developing them, expressing your vision, etc. Long live filmmaking.",
