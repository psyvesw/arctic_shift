    "body": "Not the commenter, but I use a new VS Code tab to prepare prompts for ChatGPT. In them, I compress the problem, paste reference code, generalize that code where needed, and try to be as clear as possible. I also often have long conceptual discussions. \n\nChatGPT is a great teacher, in particular of idiomatic approaches. At other times it sends you in circles, you just need to be careful to spot the difference. \n\nUsing ChatGPT a lot you may weaken some m muscles, while strengthening others. You may climb up on the architectural scale, similar to how programmers did when they switched from assembler to higher programming languages. \n\nOverall though, I noticed that after some days you *will* get the hang of something you asked about and sort of internalize it for the better... and you will also build out an internal thought process that starts with very structured organized questions. I was recently out and didn't bother to take out ChatGPT for a challenge I had in mind, but saw my brain was already working on preparing a good question -- on writing a prompt! I then answered that prompt myself. Fun!",
