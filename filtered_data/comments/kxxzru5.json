    "body": "I'm a professional programmer and I think it's great. People have the wrong idea that it's going to write whole applications or large complex functionality for you. It's going to give you broken and incomplete bullshit if you do that. But if I want to know if the C++ standard library has built-in functionality to do something I want, or questions about niche or obscure parts of the language... It knocks it out of the park almost every time. \"I know C++20 has X feature; how do I do the same thing in C++17?\" I went from lukewarm at git to proficient very quickly just by asking it every question that came to mind. I'm not afraid of git anymore. It's pretty good at LaTeX and TikZ too.\n\nOf course, you can Google for this stuff, but Google is getting much worse and you have to wade through a bunch of crap to find what you want (if it's out there), and ChatGPT lets you customize your questions to your specific scenario. It's best at stuff that's well-documented, but ain't nobody got time to read all of the documentation for every piece of technology that they use.",
