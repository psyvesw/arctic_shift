    "body": "I agree. Learning a daw took me out of a dark spot. Then came ai. And I'm like. All the money I invested and I do rent to own system  for my daw. Tomorr0w it's with 1 click.  Why would I learn. But also shock how good what AI put out there is. \n\nBut it's unstoppable. Look it's not there in video land where it's supposed to be. But use it as a tool. \n\nI say that. I made an ignorance song with 3 genres made by ai. And I thought illtry mix them together. It felt so wrong and not fun. I stopped for weeks now. Sigh\n\nI know music is about the process blablabla but I'm not even sure I can keep up financially.  I dont know where this is going. Should I stop the plan ? Should I just focus on purely instruments then. I dunno. \n\nUse it ! Uuuuuseeee ! Be better than ai by knowing what it is and turning it's generations into real artwork with your mind. And use that time u have free to make it even better. Better earlier than later. \n\nBut I get it I do. *kicks the rooomba* (I don't have one but I imagine )",
