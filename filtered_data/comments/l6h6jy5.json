    "body": ">If GPT can sufficiently argue as to why it believes a change is necessary, or explain the rationale behind a particular recommendation, then it\u2019s not just giving answers.\n\n>Absolutely because tutors don't give answers. They give feedback and explain things in the context of the specific course material.\n\nGPT can function as a tutor, so it is the student's responsibility to use it wisely and responsibly. Students can provide course-specific details to ensure more tailored and effective feedback.\n\n>You\u2019re [sic] brain doesn't work as much to make those connections and we've seen it before by observing a decline in memory following personal devices that can store information. You can find studies on this if you are interested.\n\nOver reliance on technology can impact memory, but tools like GPT can also support effective learning by providing personalized feedback and deep engagement with the material, similar to a tutor. \n\nAre you aware of any studies on the effectiveness of GPT in learning, that also take into consideration the potential drawbacks of relying on personal devices?",
