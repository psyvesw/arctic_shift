    "body": "Yes. The speed of development is what is hard for me to fathom.  And I dismissed the impact of early versions of new tech over and over.  Until AI. \n\nI heard about the internet the first time in college when one of my nerdy classmates said he could chat in real time with other students around the world. I thought ok, like a telephone on the computer. Whatever.  It took another five years for a colleague to tell me he bought a computer book online, when I thought it seemed sketch to enter a credit card number into a computer.  Three years after that I was one of the nerds who gave online dating a try when most people laughed about it. Five years later, YouTube offered short low quality  videos that skipped a lot. My nerdy partner at the time thought it would be fun to do a comedy sketch show which I thought would be ridiculous and who would watch such a thing.  Two years later iPhone etc etc. \n\nAs a software PM it took months to develop a marginally interesting software tool with a team of skilled engineers.  Last month I put a team on a new product, they could accomplish in days what just a few years ago took a year to build. \n\nThe rate of change is almost hard to get my head around. Take a summer vacation and come back to mind blowing new tech. And as I get older time seems to speed up, making it even more jarring.",
