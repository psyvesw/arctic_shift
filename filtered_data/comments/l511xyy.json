It's not her fault OAI didn't do their legal due diligence. \n\n>With Disney, SJ was out to get what was hers.\n\nNo...she was out to punish Disney. She took a legal course of action that ended up with her getting less money than she would have had settling. \n\n>If she goes after OpenAI, it appears she would be going after what is that other voice actress\u2019 work, which she was apparently still getting paid for as long as the Sky voice was active.\n\nThat actress has already been paid. There are almost certainly no royalties attached to that work, and even if there were, that actress can sue OAI for those lost royalties if ScarJo does end up suing them.",
