    "body": "> Child porn should be illegal. \n\nOnly if its production involves harming children (or other people).\n\n> Its all just ways for people to masturbate to the idea of a child\n\nPresumably. But, as long as this process does not harm an actual child, why do you care?\n\n> and a percentage of those people will want to move on to real images or worse.\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIncreases in video game consumption have no led to increases in school shootings. Likewise, increases in porn consumption have not led to increases of sexual abuse. Therefore, it is safe to assume that increases in child porn consumption will not lead to increases in the sexual abuse of children.\n\n>  or new [pedos] being generated\n\nThat is maybe the only argument on your part where I can see at least a bit of a point, but this, too, seems a bit vague and inconclusive.\n\nFor example, porn addiction definitely has some negative consequences on those people afflicted by it, but I am not aware of them being a danger to the rest of society - at most, they will have a harder time forming decent relationships with other people, but overall, this seems like less of a problem than, for example, alcohol addiction. So, considering the number of involved hypotheticals... it just doesn't seem like making AI-generated child porn more easily accessible will much of an effect at all, at least not compared to the many many other things we tolerate other people doing them, despite them being definitely quite a bit more harmful.",
