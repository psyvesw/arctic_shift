    "body": "Oh, come on, let\u2019s not kid ourselves here. This whole premise about \"focusing on substance\" and \"engaging directly with the content\" sounds like a noble pursuit until you realize it\u2019s basically a nice way of saying, \u201cIgnore the elephant in the room.\u201d The fact that AI like ChatGPT is being used in debates is not just a trivial detail\u2014it's a game changer! If someone is using an AI, that's part of the \"substance\" and should be addressed, not glossed over.\n\nAs for \u201craising questions\u201d and \u201cpushing for depth,\u201d isn\u2019t that just a polite way of saying we should interrogate and possibly intimidate? This idea that AI responses are inherently generic or lacking depth\u2014well, isn\u2019t that a bit presumptuous? Some AIs can delve pretty deep, perhaps deeper than some humans on their off days!\n\nAnd oh, the classic\u2014introducing nuance. As if every conversation must turn into a graduate thesis defense. Sometimes, straightforward answers are not only sufficient but preferred. Life isn\u2019t always shades of gray\u2014sometimes, black and white answers are exactly what we need.\n\nUsing credible sources? Well, let\u2019s throw in everything but the kitchen sink while we\u2019re at it! But seriously, while sourcing is important, it can also lead to a link-throwing contest rather than a genuine debate. It\u2019s not always about who can cite the most papers or dig up the most obscure references.\n\nClarifying and summarizing sounds like a good strategy\u2014if you\u2019re writing a textbook! But in a dynamic debate, over-summarizing can kill the flow and turn vibrant discussions into repetitive monologues.\n\nLastly, staying calm and respectful is fine advice for a tea party, but let's not pretend that every debate is going to be a calm discussion of ideas. Debates can get heated; they\u2019re about clashing viewpoints, and a bit of fire can serve a purpose. This isn\u2019t about creating a zen garden; it\u2019s about passionately defending beliefs and sometimes challenging others\u2019 viewpoints head-on.\n\nSo there, while these strategies might work in an ideal world, the real world of debates\u2014especially those involving AI\u2014is far messier and demands a more spirited approach!",
