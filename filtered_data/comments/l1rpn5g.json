    "body": "I'd break down my answer into four reasons:\n\n1. I'm a creature of habit. I did extensive research several months ago and concluded ChatGPT worked best for be at that time. I just haven't tried to retest and research why I should switch.\n2. My extensive chat history. Although if ChatGPT offered a native way to search through past chats, this be stronger reason to stay. As it is, I tend to just re-ask certain questions, if I can't immediately find a similar, previous chat among the list of hundreds.\n3. Custom GPTs. I have a few of my own I created, and I like a few of them that others have made.\n4. At one point, you couldn't sign up for ChatGPT, because too many people were jumping on the wagon, so I don't want to be in the position of wanting to return and then having to wait months to be able to upgrade again.\n\nI'd love to hear counter-arguments against those, especially if, for example, Claude allows searching or custom instructions.",
