    "body": "I think a lot of people fear that, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s based on real evidence of consequences. It was once the case that being able to type on an electric typewriter without looking at the keys was an important skill for the workplace. Now almost no one is taught this once-essential skill. Writing well may be relegated to the same bin of outdated skill-sets for the workplace. But many skills that are outdated for the general workforce are still taught, and taken up by specialists. Like draftsmanship for architecture, or mixing paint for physical art (which still exists, even with the ubiquity of digital painting tools). I\u2019ve often said myself that we overestimate the intelligence of AI\u2019s because we conflate writing well with being intelligent. Maybe the reverse is also true, that we overestimate the importance for humans of being able to write well. I\u2019m not sure I agree, and I know any writing teacher surely would not, but it\u2019s something to consider. I have read of one study that found that in general, the ability to spell has declined since the introduction of predictive text. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more evidence beyond that, and there are definitely confounding factors, like de-emphasizing the importance of teaching correct spelling throughout the curriculum in grade school (in the US at least). Perhaps we humans just need to make a decision that we value good writing by other humans, and then act accordingly.",
