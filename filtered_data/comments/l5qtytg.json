    "body": "If AI only has to enable students to pass exams as they exist in current schooling systems, then it will be something like 3-5 years before AI is doing more tutoring than humans are. What this ignores, though, is that the current schooling system (for the most part) will produce graduates who will only reliably understand how to do things that can also be done fairly easily by AI.\n\nBoth employment and education are about to become massively disrupted, or some sort of Butlerian Jihad for children is going to happen, whereby students will be completely denied the use of network technology while in school, and school will be all about developing the capability to act independently of such technology.",
