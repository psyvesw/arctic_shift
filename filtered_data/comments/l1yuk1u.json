    "body": "I continue using ChatGPT for several reasons. Firstly, Gemini didn't impress me at all; it often got most questions wrong, especially in math. Claude, while intriguing, isn't available in the EU, and when I tried it, I found it quite limited, allowing only a few requests every couple of hours, which is very restrictive especially considering it also costs $20. Lastly, Llama 3 can't handle files, which is a dealbreaker for me.\n\nChatGPT, on the other hand, offers a user-friendly interface and a broad knowledge base that consistently provides relevant and detailed answers. This is crucial for my research and daily inquiries. Its ability to understand and generate natural language responses smoothly and intuitively keeps me coming back. What's been your experience with the alternatives you mentioned?",
