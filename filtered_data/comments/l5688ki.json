Many of the advances we are seeing including ChatGPT are in the private sector.\n\nIts not just novels we would lose. The person who wrote your college textbook would not have written it, because why? News articles - gone. Movies and video games- gone.\n\nI think that you are arguing maybe we dont need jobs anymore. We certainly aren\u2019t there now. I\u2019m also confused why you want a scenario where AI is doing all the creative work and humans the menial labor and manufacturing.",
