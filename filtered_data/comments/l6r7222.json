    "body": "Like I said, you are assuming how I am using it.\n\nI am using it less for its information specifically, and more for its ability to regurgitate, make lists, etc. It is a reference material and starting point for additional research. For example, I read a book by Carlo Rovelli, and an idea intrigues me. I have a brief conversation with it about chatgpt, and ask it for some relevant sources to look at to dig deeper.\n\nIn this way I am treating it the way I would another person, I don\u2019t necessarily trust their information and do my own research, but it gives me an additional outside perspective to process what I just learned from. Right or wrong, just as a person could be, it doesn\u2019t matter as I ask it to back up any claims with references. then I do my research and fact check.\n\n\nfor coding I use it similarly, as if it were a programming instructor or the like. I ask it to help me build a plan to learn about LLMs. or like I ask it to help me accomplish a task and it helps me understand the steps, where I can look to dig deeper, high level overview which I can easily validate, etc.\n\n\nAgain, I think that you assume I am using it in a way that necessitates fully valid factual functioning outputs. I do not. it is simply an external conversation machine which i throw ideas at, and it throws ideas back. and then if anything actionable comes of it makes factual claims I do my own research to validate.",
