    "body": "I am hopelessly, rapaciously creative. Always have been, I can't stop myself. I've spent thousands and thousands of hours of my life honing my skills, and pouring myself into projects and feeling proud of myself. The idea that anyone can create what I can create is quite jarring, and it's a bruise to my ego, but the thing is, I'm at least self aware enough to recognize that it's ego.\n\nWhy should everyone be able to enjoy creating and expressing like I do? Why would I try to emotionally gatekeep and wish to ban anyone from being able to express? The whole \"If you wanna do art, learn how to do art!\" thing... why? Not everyone WANTS to spend their lives, or even has the time to invest.\n\nIf AI art isn't for you, don't use it. To get all dogmatic about it and heavily judge people for using it seems sad and self-unaware to me.\n\nPeople deserve to express themselves.",
