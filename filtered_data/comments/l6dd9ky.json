    "body": "Most of the people I really can't seem to grasp the potential of chatGPT. They still make very basic prompts thinking complicated prompts or giving it too much information will mess it up. They for some reason always end it at one or two prompts even though they could have done with more prompts to get more information and get some more explanations on things. They always start new chats after that even if its on the same topic.\n\nThey basically treat it like google. And these people never used to google anything either. Also they don't use ChatGPT a lot. Like I've only seen them use it for preparing assignments and presentation scripts. I have told them they can use it to organize notes for the exam and make it easy to memorize, coding without any knowledge of coding, translating things in specific ways, analyzing documents and photos, getting feedback, math. Like, the best way to use chatGPT, and what makes this different from just using google is that you can insert tons of data and have chatGPT process that data into whatever you need. But they only ever use it like its google. They don't even ask it to write answers in specific formats when making it do assignments or applications or whatever, like telling it to write it in the form of an application, etc. They just write the topic name and copies and pastes it.",
