    "body": "Yup, I work with many scientists and they're too busy with life to give ah shit. They're impressed, but don't understand how to use it. I do, so I use it at work and am considered awesome - but because they don't care, I shine like a rock star - with doing little work Ahahahha\n\nNo really, really - not just co-workers, but even college students and high school students are slightly impressed, but for the most part, nobody seems to care.\n\nI have a theory: for adults not caring, they've been doing the same shit for so long they're happy as is: for adults not caring they have a life, family and bills to contend with. For the college science students I've showed it to, they just don't know the magnitude of Ai power and how to adopt it. For the high schoolers, its just not as fun as Twitch, YouTube, Xbox.",
