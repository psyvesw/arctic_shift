    "body": "Sometimes I like to throw in a pair of headphones, turn on headphone mode in chatGPT, go out for a walk, and do a deep dive into a topic asking questions. Sometimes it will start when I'm reading, watching a video, or listening to a podcast and I am curious about the specifics of something. Other times, I will just have something come up I want to learn more about.\n\nLast night for example I heard about secondary fermentation when it comes to brewing beer. I have only brewed a few times so far and last night wad the first time i had ever heard about it. I threw on shoes, put in headphones, and over the course of a ~2 mile walk I learned all about it, when it is needed, when it is not needed, and then dove in on random other things GPT mentioned when explaining it to me. It feels weird at first, but I highly reccomend giving it a shot! GPT4 also does a way better job than trying to use copilots integrated voice functionality for free, which is why I decided to start paying for Plus in the first place.",
