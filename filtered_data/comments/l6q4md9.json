    "body": "I feel similarly mystified that people aren't paying more attention. I think it's primarily a failure of attention, awareness, and imagination. Which is sometimes exacerbated by negative views of AI that inhibit seeking more information about AI or testing its capabilities for yourself. And of course plenty who are just apathetic and not interested in things beyond their control.  \n\nMost people are unaware of AI's current capabilities, the wider implications and likely impacts of these current capabilities, how quickly these capabilities are advancing, and the *future* wider implications and likely impacts of these *future* capabilities.  \n\nOnce you start following AI news, you begin to see just what a wild, fast-paced ride it is. But many people's relationship with AI is just vague news reports, being annoyed by their social media feeds being flooded by pictures with weird hands, artists losing jobs, high profile failures like Gemini's image generation, a famous actress' voice being \"stolen\", and so on. Those are the things people casually encounter. So people aren't seeing the big picture.",
