    "body": "Yeah, it's interesting how everyone automatically goes to NPCs in RPGs as the ultimate application of this technology. I'd be more excited to get some sort of personal assistant in a Paradox game such as Stellaris or Victoria 3. An AI that's aware of your game state and able to offer suggestions for strategies would be pretty cool. (Of course, a CK3 in which you could converse with all the characters in your court would be pretty nifty too.) \n\nI think AI assistants in general are perhaps a more immediately useful application of this technology, and I can easily see someone like Microsoft deploying a Copilot API on Xbox for game developers to hook into, offsetting the cost by creating a new $30/month tier of Game Pass, or something like that. Then if someone gets stuck somewhere in a game they can ask for assistance, or if they're playing something like a sprawling open world and have lost track of what they were doing, they can call upon the AI to help them prioritize their in-game activities, recap plot events, etc.",
