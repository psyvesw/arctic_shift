    "body": "Oh of course and I totally agree with you on this! AI is useful development, and I always use it to \"brainstorm\" as I explained in my last paragraph; it's okay to use AI; sometimes even it might give me something that I didn't think of that'd work, sometimes not; it is a hit or miss for more complex problems (sometimes the chances of it giving you something tailored are close to none if you encounter a problem that never happened before) but for most common problems, it is actually pretty good and will save you a lot of time reading through documentation or StackOverflow.\n\nAlso my bad for the late reply; I don't browse reddit much. And Yes, the OP might have phrased it like AI is not useful at all; I disagree with this too)) It is very useful, just not in an \"absolute\" way; others may find AI useful only in refactoring, yet I find it useful in brainstorming too, etc.\n\nIt is not the omnipotent kind of AI with the ultimate unmistakable logic and the infinitely creative problem-solving capabilities that I imagined (or rather, hoped for), but it is still the kind of AI that's statistically more useful than not.",
