    "body": "\"can just as easily be searched without it.\"\n\nSo you didn't watch the video or read the papers results that this is simply not true and the entire point of the paper.\n\nYou didn't even get to the actual data of the paper, so of course you just wave away the notion you'd have to counter it's data or findings in some way. \n\nThe entire point of the excitement is that because GPT showed efficiency and quality increases over humans in the process, then one can presume future models will have even more impact. That is simply a true statement. These are the worst models we'll ever use and the paper already shows these gains. \n\nAlso I'm going to pass on your judgement of a YouTuber being a \"golden retriever\" until you can demonstrate you actually understand the paper he just explained to you.",
