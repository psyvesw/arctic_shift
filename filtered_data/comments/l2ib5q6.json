    "body": "In the doc you can go to properties where there is a word count and a time spent editing area.  If it shows hours of work in the timer count then you may have an argument.  \n\nI have used that to circumstantially argue that a defendant cut and paste former employee IP, as the edit time was like 1 minute, and they couldn\u2019t provide another other doc with longer time recorded.  So the opposite, but might assist in the argument. As suggested by someone else in this thread, an oral (off paper) monologue on the subject matter and the conclusion might also assist in having it flagged. \n\nPro tip: don\u2019t use AI to reformat any sentence with the words you intend to use.  Have it format something similar and then use that for inspiration - dont cut and paste, and absolutely type every character.  Do not ever cut and paste from elsewhere.  Version control is also great - save the file with the date stamp in the file name each time you work on files as that\u2019s irrefutable version control (you can\u2019t back-track that as the editing stats in word will trip you up)",
