    "body": "The fact that GPT can't learn on the fly makes its intelligence *feel* so much less impressive. Even if you and GPT agree 100% that you're right it will still get it wrong every time you open a new window.\n\nI don't know how to compare it to a person. It might be like having a brilliant friend who thinks George Bush is president and you talk to him and he says \"oh of course!\" but then next time you meet and every time after he still says GW is president.\n\nGPT, as a fellow intelligence, *feels* brain damaged. And because of that we write it off as not as relevant as it is.",
