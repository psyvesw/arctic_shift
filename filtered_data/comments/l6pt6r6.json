    "body": "Hi, I worked in high performance computing for all my professional life, and at some point I also worked in a contract research project for the NSA, and I can shed a bit of light on your question.\n\nSurprisingly, a large amount of research that the NSA funds is relatively open and easy to find. Academics and researchers belonging to the private sector that work on NSA contracts frequently **can publish** and patent their results, and both the patents and the papers will carry open verbiage either saying that the invention is  transferred to the NSA, or that the research work was performed with NSA funding. \n\nShort story, there's certainly some research that is secret, but the vast majority of projects of non-trivial size that require industrial collaborations with chipmakers are harder to keep secret. They have a significant budget, but their budget is NOTHING compared to what the retail gaming sector spends. In fact, all the aggregate government supercomputing spending in the world is small compared to how much gamers spend in GPUs plus what cloud providers these days in GPUs.\n\nThe AI revolution was really possible because high-performance computing and supercomputing in the last 20 years have piggy-backed on the shoulders of gaming.\n\nThe NSA possesses large private clusters with modern hardware, but their aggregate size is negligible compared with the compute capacity of Google, Amazon and MS-Azure.",
