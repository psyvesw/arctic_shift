    "body": "Right, that's where the class action lawsuits would come in. But, for sure, the emotional trauma and psychological damage would be pretty huge, if there were more people like Theodore and his female friend that depended upon them not just for work but also for emotional/relationship support.\n\nI imagine OpenAI (and all the others) are all aware of the implications when lonely human beings find themselves drawn to virtual beings. Though I still think a LLM isn't going to really do much, no matter how advanced it may seem. It's when we see AGI going mainstream that we'll hear a lot more about virtual relationships.",
