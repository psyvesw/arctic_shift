    "body": "Hey everyone, I'm just sharing my experience with this new AI detection software we're using in academia. So, here's the deal: the software tells us what percentage of a student's work it thinks is AI-generated. But here's the kicker \u2013 it's not always accurate. Even after the software says it's 98% confident, there's still a chance it messes up.\n\nMe and some other teachers tested it out, and sometimes stuff we wrote ourselves gets flagged as AI-generated. Crazy, right? So, we can't just blindly trust this software. It's more like a clue that needs backup evidence.\n\nOh, and if you're using Grammarly or similar tools, watch out. They can make your work seem more AI-like, even if you didn't use any fancy AI stuff. I've seen students get flagged as 100% AI, when all they did was run their essay through a proofreader.\n\nAnd here's a tip for students: write your stuff in Google Drive or something similar. That way, you can show your editing history if there's any trouble.\n\nTeachers asking to chat about your paper? They're not accusing you of anything. They're just trying to figure out why the AI software is acting up.\n\nAnd hey, if you're a teacher thinking of going back to old-school paper writing, maybe think again. We gotta adapt to the times. Our students aren't gonna be handwriting essays in their future jobs. Using tools like Google Drive to track edits can actually help us see who's using AI and who's not.\n\nLet's talk about this more. AI's here to stay, and we gotta figure out how to use it smartly in our classrooms.",
