    "body": "The internet was so big because it was a tool that provided service, it connects two or more really far away systems and allows information to be exchanged. The skepticism of this was mainly down to not understanding/not seeing how things could be built ontop of it and early on you had to be really clued up on how to use it properly. This is kind of understandable, the internet of today is a really complicated system under the hood and a huge undertaking by many cooperating partners including partners at an international level, to envision something like that back in 1980s from just TCP/IP protocol and some copper wires would be very hard.\n\nI think ChatGPT is more akin to something like a Search Engine or digital storage, its like an end user tool that will essentially make other things that fill the gap redundant. Which is great and something to be really excited about - it means the world suddenly becomes more efficient at mundane tasks, think about paper file storage vs digital file storage - but its not got the same utility and scope as something like the internet.",
