    "body": "A while back I talked to ChatGPT about it and it told me about the compelxity of the human brain compared to itself. Humans are way more complex and this is one of the reasons AI cannot match up at all and cannot achieve any intelligence or understanding. AI currently just use terraform nueral networks, and reinforcement learning , they do not learn from experience and reshape themselves in a way humans do. They also cannot physically reshape themselves like us. The trick is to create an AI that can learn  and write its own code. Moreover , it needs a large physical location or body and it needs to have control and over and have materials accessible to change or alter itself. Something like this is straight out of science fiction and it is scary but CHATGPT talked about Nueromorphic computing , mimicking the human brain and have nueromorphic chips that act like biological neurons and synapses. The material might include memristors which can change their resistance based on the history of electrical activity passing thorough them. It also talked about phase change materials and Spintronics and a reconfigurable architecture. It also needs to be energy efficient like the human brain. This will a physically present AI with a physically alterable nueral network. Kind of a crazy idea but we need something similar to make an AGI and surpass humans but the question is , what if we end up making a machine conscious ?",
