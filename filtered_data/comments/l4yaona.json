    "body": "She was asked by OpenAI to lend her voice, which she declined, then they proceed to make the demo sound like her voice, Altman tweets out Her where she voiced the AI, and they asked her right before they released the demo if she would lend her voice. This situations has already been established by the courts.\n\nThis idea is already established in law so she isn\u2019t in the wrong for getting a attorney. You can\u2019t ask an actor if they can use your voice, and if they say no hire an impersonator. This is established in the law already. Here\u2019s one example that\u2019s very similar showing you can\u2019t do this:\n\nBette Midler knows rights of publicity. She used her right of publicity to prevent use of a sound-alike singer to sell cars.\n\nFord Motor Co. hired one of Midler\u2019s backup singers to sing on a commercial \u2013 after Midler declined to do the ad \u2013 and asked her to sound as much like Midler as possible. It worked, and fooled a lot of people, including some close to Midler. Midler sued, and the court ruled that there was a misappropriation of Midler\u2019s right of publicity to her singing voice.\n\nThe bottom line: Midler\u2019s singing voice was hers to control. Ford had no right to use it without her permission. That lesson cost Ford a tidy $400,000.\n\nSource: https://higgslaw.com/celebrities-sue-over-unauthorized-use-of-identity/",
