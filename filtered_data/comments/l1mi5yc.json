    "body": "This seems a dumb question but imho is not, in reality I think pretty much they don't know how to make it, plus there are other limitations such as compute power and energy required, given the current state with LLM and their improvements in reasoning seems like we're not quite there at AGI level yet, I don't think anyone knows for sure what's missing, different architecture or what, seems to me that big companies are trying to solve the problems (such as context length, memory, reasoning etc) but a step at the time seeing if it works better, if you think about the rumors of OpenAI for example working on different models that they *seem* to have stopped such as Arrakis and maybe Gobi etc, looks like they're trying different stuff and discover what works what not, this is my perception at least, might be wrong of course.",
