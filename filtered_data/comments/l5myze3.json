    "body": "Yup. Ppl who are saying \"oh don't worry it sucks\" are morons. They are looking at a brand new product and fail to comprehend exponential growth in science and technology. That's like saying \"oh the internet sucks\" back in 1995. \n\nIn 5 years ai will control almost everything we do. Should we worry about our jobs? Yes and no. If everyone loses their jobs, the economy collapses and we're all fucked so there will still be things we as a society need to do to mitigate that. Whether it's free education to retrain everyone for new jobs or ubi, it will have to be something. Or else we're all fucked. Even trades guys that have jobs. No one will pay them for their work if the ppl who used to pay them don't have job and money.",
