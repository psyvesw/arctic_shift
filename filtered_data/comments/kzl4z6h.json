    "body": "Story callout: Seeking Canadian university students falsely accused of using AI in academic work\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am reaching out specifically to those of you who have been falsely accused of using artificial intelligence (AI) in your academic work. I\u2019m a journalist for a large Canadian newspaper working on a story to shed light on this issue and hoping to connect with students with first-hand experience. \n\nIf you have been unjustly accused of using AI in your assignments, despite not having done so, I would like to hear your story. If you are interested in chatting with me about your experiences, please message me to connect, and we can go from there! Please note any questions you may have will be answered by me and more information will be provided about the publication to any sources before an official interview.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and thank you in advance for your willingness to share your experiences.",
