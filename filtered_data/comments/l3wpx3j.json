It's following along ideas from GPT researcher\n\nIt has APIs/search set up already, so you don't have to wrestle with deployment yourself. Just got updated to gpt-4o, it's quite good!\n\nHere's what's hapenning behind the scenes\n\n* your inquiry is expanded into search queries, inspired by techniques from HyDE paper\n* HTML markup is cleaned up and put into search index, powered by OpenAI embeddings search\n* High level outline of a result is written, using high level overview from sources\n* For each paragraph title in a review, most relevant chunks from sources are used to write a body of paragraph\n* Each paragraph has links to webpages used in writing\n\nIt has a trial, give it a try \ud83d\udd2e",
