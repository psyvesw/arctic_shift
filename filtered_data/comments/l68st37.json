    "body": "You absolutely did. Despite showing a lack of understanding of opiod addiction you made the analogy of replacing the drug of choice with an alternative. \nYou're wrong when you state the addiction  is always equally harmful no matter how it's filled. That's untrue. In many countries they guve heroin addicts safe pure medical heroin in injecting rooms. This results in heroin being consumed in a way that produces less harm. In other countries they supply addicts with an alternative less harmful alternative.\n\nIf a paedophile consumes AI generated CP then they do less harm then if they consume real CP. Therefore it's a less harmful alternative exactly equivalent to opiod replacement programs.\n\nPaedophiles who seek help should be prescribed ai generated CP and also child sex dolls. This will reduce the harm they would have caused to real children. \n\nBut of course you guys don't really care about reducing harm to children. You are just in this for the feelings of self righteousness you get from a good witch-hunt",
