    "body": ">I'm seeing trouble in the community over peer-reviewed papers containing terms like, \"I'm sorry but I'm a language model...\"\n\nYou are describing the results of laziness and stupidity, which are not problems that AI brought with it, moreover lazinss and stupidity existed and were plenty obvious before LLMs existed.\n\nSomething else that also existed before AI; the poisoning of the peer review process by vested interests.\n\nCases where basic fact checking is missed == not properly peer reviewed. Banning AI wont fix this and it was already broken long before AI arrived.\n\nI feel like people need AI to be perfect and anything short of that isn't acceptable - when we've been doping it all with humans who mess things up on the regular. \n\nIt doesn't need to be perfect and honestly it feels like you are blaming it for showing the extent of the actual problems with our peer review process and the for profit motives and vested interests that have infested it. The fact that \"peer reviewed\" articles are letting things like \"as a language model trained by OpenAI\" is a good thing - you just found a bunch of liars rubber stamping scientific papers without reading them. This is a great way of exposing idiots and charlatans and the less of them in the research field, the better.",
