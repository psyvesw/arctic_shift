    "body": "Well, think about it.  We've abstracted all that stuff.  What does that mean? Well, we took hard to understand (for the average person) machine and assembly language and and abstracted it into higher and higher level languages until we have something as easy to read as Python for instance. Then we took that one step further and abstracted it to natural language. Now I can just tell an LLM what I want (soon this will be nearly flawless) and it will present the product. The ultimate goal is to abstact it to the point where idea to product is hardly even considered by most people. Then it comes down to who has the best ideas. You're not irrelevant as long as you continue to learn and improve your ability to have new ideas.",
