    "body": "I was with you, right up until the second-to-the-last paragraph. LLM\u2019s are nowhere near that good yet. They can\u2019t actually write better than any human, and that\u2019s just the start of how far they are falling short of the hype at this point. I did laugh at your first couple of paragraphs, though, because I was there too, and I remember being the only one in my workplace who was amazed and impressed with everything a personal computer could do. (And ironically enough, I\u2019ve had the same experience as OP, only I\u2019m the mom in this case, and it\u2019s my college-age kid who goes \u2018yeah, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just not that cool\u2019 when I show him what ChatGPT or DALL-E are capable of.)",
