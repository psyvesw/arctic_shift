    "body": "I need opinion on what should I do with my case\n\nI\u2019m being expelled because of Plagiarism. What happened was, our professor assigned us to do a reflection paper. I used chat gpt to generate some ideas. Though the work of chatgpt sparked an idea, I didn\u2019t use it because it wasn\u2019t good enough. I swear my work and chatgpt is WAAAAY different. What I did wrong is, I accidentally submitted my work with the work of the chatgpt on the second page. That was what used against me. They\u2019ve taken the investigation lightly and just came out with the decision to expel me. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve even compared my work and what has chatgpt generated.",
