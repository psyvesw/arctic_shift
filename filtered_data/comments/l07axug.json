    "body": "Yes. I've used it on and off since Bard. I use AI mostly for research and for editing (i.e. fixing typos and grammatical errors only). When I ask it to review my podcast transcripts for punctuation errors and typos only (NOT rewrite or add anything), Gemini always rewrites and add things. \n\nWe had a fight the other day. My transcript started right into the episode. Gemini added, \"Hey guys! Welcome to this episode.\" When I pointed out that I had indeed not said that, to only fix punctuation errors (Descript makes a l lot of those), and any typos, Gemini came back with, \"Hi everyone! Welcome to the podcast.\" Which again I had not said. There was more nonsense and I finally gave up, going back to ChatGPT and pasting in the transcript section by section (it was too long originally).",
