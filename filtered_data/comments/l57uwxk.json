    "body": "I use ScholarGPT to help me find relevant scientific papers. If my question is too niche it's not too useful amd kinda frustrating when it ignores your instructions to strictly exclude certain topics. But sometimes I hit a jackpot.\n\nMy research is too niche to use chatGPT for anything worthy though, so I used it to generate some general introductions to topics, which I had ro edit heavily. So it's not that useful in my thesis.\n\nMy customGPT that I loaded with my research paper doesn't seem to read it very thoroughly so It's kinda useless. Maybe I just don't know how to \"program\" it properly.\n\nOtherwise it's great for random life questions, but if researchers want to use it someday, a language program is not going to be sufficient. We really need a genuine AI.",
