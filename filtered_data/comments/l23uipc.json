    "body": "Turnitin (and any other AI detector tool) does not work well enough to be used as a basis for academic integrity decisions. Here is a list of statements from a range of major US universities on why they won't support the use of Turnitin AI detection or other such tools for academic integrity:\n\n[Alabama - Turnitin AI writing detection unavailable](https://cit.ua.edu/known-issue-turnitin-ai-writing-detection-unavailable/)\n\n[UC Berkley \u2013 Availability of Turnitin Artificial Intelligence Detection](https://rtl.berkeley.edu/news/availability-turnitin-artificial-intelligence-detection)\n\n[UCF - Faculty Center - Artificial Intelligence](https://fctl.ucf.edu/technology/artificial-intelligence/)\n\n[Colorado State - Why you can\u2019t find Turnitin\u2019s AI Writing Detection tool](https://tilt.colostate.edu/why-you-cant-find-turnitins-ai-writing-detection-tool/)\n\n[MIT \u2013 AI Detectors Don\u2019t Work. Here\u2019s What to do Instead](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/)\n\n[Missouri \u2013 Detecting Artificial Intelligence (AI) Plagiarism](https://teachingtools.umsystem.edu/support/solutions/articles/11000119557-detecting-artificial-intelligence-ai-plagiarism)\n\n[Northwestern \u2013 Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Courses](https://ai.northwestern.edu/education/use-of-generative-artificial-intelligence-in-courses.html)\n\n[SMU \u2013 Changes to Turnitin AI Detection Tool at SMU](https://blog.smu.edu/itconnect/2023/12/13/discontinue-turnitin-ai-detection-tool/)\n\n[Syracuse \u2013 Detecting AI Created Content](https://answers.syr.edu/display/blackboard01/Detecting+AI+Created+Content)\n\n[Vanderbilt \u2013 Guidance on AI Detection and Why We\u2019re Disabling Turnitin\u2019s AI Detector](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/)\n\n[Yale \u2013 AI Guidance for Teachers](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/AIguidance)\n\nLook for a similar policy statement from your university's office of academic integrity or IT/academic technology. Even if they do support the use of Turnitin AI detection (which, to reiterate, does not work) they will almost certainly not allow investigations or decisions solely on the basis of the \"detection\" report. If your professor tries to insist on penalizing you without further evidence of cheating, escalate to the office of academic integrity or the academic dean. Share the above list and ask for a specific statement of which of your school's policies you are accused of violating, and what evidence they have that you did so.",
