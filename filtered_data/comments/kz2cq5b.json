I didn't mean \"it is unable to scold me\".\n\n  \nIt is not really free market capitalism because they were supposed to be a non-profit organisation but no longer are through lots of loops. And now it is really hard to reach chatGPT's level of competence.\n\nIf there was an LLM with the same quality as chatGPT but without installed biases or \"guardrails\" I think most people would prefer that.\n\nI keep using the same example but would you rather use a regular knife or one that gives you an ethics lesson about how a knife can be a dangerous object or refuse to work if you try to cut certain things (like meat because meat is bad for the environment)?",
