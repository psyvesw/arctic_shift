    "body": "Yeah this is probably fake but for the last 2 days GPT is giving me really, seriously lazy answers.\n\nFor example just now:\n\nLet's discuss how the future would look/work if AI and robotics can do 95% of human work for the same or cheaper?\n\nChatGPT: \"In a future where AI and robotics handle 95% of human work, society could undergo profound changes. Economies would shift towards more creative, strategic, and interpersonal jobs. The need for a universal basic income might become widespread to ensure livelihoods. Education would emphasize skills like critical thinking and creativity over routine tasks. This era could also prompt significant ethical and policy debates regarding wealth distribution, the role of work in life, and human-machine interaction, potentially leading to a more leisure-focused society but also raising questions about purpose and identity.\"\n\n  \nThat's it? This is our 'discussion'? \n\nYesterday I asked it to describe some basic aspects of making a living online, as I'm tired of a friend who keeps asking me. Got the same short little paragraphs. I'll show ya:\n\nChatGPT: \"Alright, let's break it down simply:\n\n* **Domain Name:** It's like your house's address, but on the internet. It's how people find your website.\n* **Hosting Company:** They're like the land where your house (website) sits. They store all your website's files so people can visit it.\n* **How Websites Work:** When you type a domain name, it's like sending a letter to that address. The hosting company receives this letter and shows you the website.\n\nThese basics help create and run websites, making them accessible to everyone online.\n\nMe: Can we try a bit harder? Take the first one, \"Domain Name: It's like your house's address, but on the internet. It's how people find your website.\" Go into more depth, like this. \"Domain Name: It's like your house's address, but on the internet. It's how people find your website, using a website address such as tony.com. You can also buy other top-level domains such as tony.org for non-profit orgs, or tony.biz etc. Generally you really want the .com if possible. You have to pay a domain name each year, typically around $15 a year. Most of the single work or obvious domain names have already been taken, so you may have to get inventive.\" Like that, see?\n\nChatGPT: \"A domain name is like your home's address on the internet, such as \"tony.com.\" It's how people find your site. You can choose from various endings like \".org\" for nonprofits or \".biz\" for businesses, but \".com\" is often preferred. Since many simple or common names are already taken, you might need to be creative. Owning a domain costs around $15 per year. This fee keeps your \"address\" under your name so visitors can always find you.\"\n\nThat was it.\n\nIf it keeps up like this I'll stop paying for it.",
