    "body": "Google is also updating its model and announced some big improvements: \n1. Project Astra : Its a visual chatbot, and sort of a version of Google Lens. It lets users open their phone cameras and ask questions about just about anything around them by pointing the camera at things. Google showed off a video demo where somebody asked Astra a variety of questions in a row based on their surroundings. this is the same as the viral video.\n\n2. VideoFX: its a generative video model based off Google DeepMind video generator Veo. It creates 1080p videos based on text prompts and allows for more flexibility within the production process than before.\n\n3. Generative Ai on youtube: they announced a new LearnML model integration with youtube to enhance the teaching experience on another level. It\u2019s a collaboration between Google\u2019s DeepMind AI research division and Google Research. Students can directly ask questions on the chat box and get real time asnwers on the youtube stream. In addition, they announced AI generated quiezes on youtube. Viewers can ask clarifying questions, get helpful explanations or take a quiz on the subject matter.\n\n4. Spam calls detection: they previewed a feature that will alert users to potential scams during the call. The system effectively listens for \u201cconversation patterns commonly associated with scams\u201d in real time. However, this also triggers the privacy concerns for the users, cause it will directly linked on your device.\n\n5. Gemini: they announced that Gemini AI will appear in the side panel of many Google apps, including Gmail, Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides with real time integration. With this, it can answer questions, help you craft emails or documents, or provide summaries of long docs or email threads.\n\nthere are many more relevant AI news, updates, and tools [here](https://forebrain.beehiiv.com).\u2026. but these were the ones i found most relevant.\n\nThanks!",
