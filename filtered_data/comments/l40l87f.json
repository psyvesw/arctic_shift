    "body": "I agree that AI don't need to mimic feelings to be useful, but honestly, the AI products out there that *aren't* useful are the ones I hear about the most from the people in my life. People are already using these AI \"assistants\"/\"companions\" same way me and my friends did as teenagers in the '00s trolling SmarterChild on AIM, but now it's actually finally fun. \n\nMy best friend has an internal company AI assistant for her job as a software dev, but when she calls me to chat, she's telling me about how she spent part of her evening talking to Harry Potter characters on character.ai for two hours. She's married and not lonely or anything, she's just having fun because she loves Harry Potter. Another friend pays for ChatGPT Plus and is using it as basically a replacement to googling things because he likes the experience, as well as the fact he can speak to it in memes (I don't fully understand why this is so important but more power to him). \n\nPersonally I agree that I don't want an AI saying it's blushing at me, but hell, I've been trying to learn a new language for the past year and I have to admit it's a lot more fun asking grammar questions to a chatbot who's programmed to mimic a video game character and gives me shit sometimes for being a beginner, compared to flipping through a reference book trying to find the declension table I need.",
