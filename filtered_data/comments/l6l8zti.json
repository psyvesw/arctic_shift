    "body": "So my experience is somewhat adjacent than yours, but maybe it helps. I run a homebrew DnD campaign and I have a ton of documents that detail plots, events, history, lore etc. I also have documents detailing the session we've played so far. It is quite a lot of words and pages and it is somewhat haphazard, I of course did not set out to have these notes read by anyone other than me but i am pretty organized.\n\nI fed a custom GPT my entire work and some instructions with the intent to get it to remind me of plot points, characters, stories, NPCs etc. and to help me brainstorm.\n\nI am quite happy with the results BUT i do not trust it fully. It has proven that sometimes it will overlook things or miss them. Sometimes that is because my notes are confusing, other times it is just wrong. All in all I would give it a 9/10. The ability to ask it to draw me things we are brainstorming is fantastic, and it has helped me avoid being stuck creatively. It also proves to be a mostly reliable assistant in getting me info i ask of it.\n\nHope this helps!",
