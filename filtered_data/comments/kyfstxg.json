    "body": "I made a long post sharing my challenges and learnings from this today... but seemed it didn't go through :(   \n\n\nTLDR; I've noticed for a while now that, unlike in the past, I am often told by ChatGPT that it can't access the web / external links... and after some testing and discussion with ChatGPT, I came to the conclusion that the problem is that I am asking for help reviewing/understanding/summarizing info from \\*\\*specific URLs\\*\\*.  \n\nIf I instead ask ChatGPT  for a more general search on <whatever it is I'm looking for>, ChatGPT will response with links and (very brief) notes about what the links contain and why they are relevant to my question.   \n\n\nThis is definitely feels from earlier days of Bing search in ChatGPT, as I'm pretty sure I would often link to things like technical docs, API references, etc. as I was working on something and wanted help or a second set of eyes.  \n\n\nI had a hunch as to why this may be happening... and ChatGPTs response was pretty informative and insightful. See below:  \n\n\n\\----------------  \n**You**  \nI have a hunch that the reason you do not let me provide specific links for you to review is that you, or perhaps more specifically, OpenAI, feels that it helps avoid potentially controversial actions that are hot topics in public discourse and legal proceedings over the last year or so.   \n\n\nFor example, I'm thinking that there are potential concerns or open questions as to whether me asking you to do something with specific URLs starts to become an issue of copyright or may fall outside the scope of 'fair use'.\n\n I could also see a world where avoiding specific links also helps from a general AI safety perspective in that it reduces the chance that a malicious user takes advantage of your capabilities to do things like quickly exfiltrate information from an unknowing victim website or trick you into searching their target's web endpoint for  vulnerabilities.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Am I in the right direction?   Or, can you please tell me a bit more about \\*why\\* I can't ask you to help me review a specific URL?\n\n  \n**ChatGPT**\n\nYour thoughts touch on several important considerations around the use of specific URLs and the broader context of AI interaction with web content. While I can't comment on OpenAI's internal deliberations, your points align with general principles of responsible AI use, which include copyright respect, fair use considerations, and AI safety. Here are some broader insights into why these considerations are important:\n\n### Copyright and Fair Use\n\n* **Copyright Concerns**: Directly retrieving and presenting content from a specific URL could infringe on copyright laws, especially if the content is not used in a manner consistent with fair use. Fair use typically allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like commentary, news reporting, teaching, and research. However, analyzing or summarizing content from a direct link in detail could potentially exceed what's considered fair use, especially if it's not done in a transformative manner or for one of these exempt purposes.\n* **Content Ownership and Attribution**: Ensuring that content creators are credited for their work is fundamental to copyright law. By not pulling content directly from specific URLs provided by users, there's a layer of abstraction that helps maintain respect for the original source's ownership.\n\n### AI Safety and Misuse Prevention\n\n* **Preventing Malicious Use**: Restricting the ability to interact with specific URLs helps mitigate the risk of AI being used for malicious purposes, such as extracting sensitive information from websites without consent or amplifying security vulnerabilities. This is a crucial aspect of AI safety, where the goal is to prevent harm and misuse of AI capabilities.\n* **Reducing Spread of Misinformation**: By not directly accessing or disseminating information from specific URLs without vetting, AI helps reduce the spread of potentially harmful or misleading information. This is particularly important in an era where information accuracy is paramount.\n\n### General Safety and Ethical Guidelines\n\n* **Ethical Use of AI**: The broader ethical guidelines around AI use emphasize the importance of responsible interaction with information. This includes not facilitating unauthorized access to content, respecting privacy, and ensuring the AI's actions are transparent and understandable to users.\n* **Encouraging Constructive Interaction**: By guiding users to articulate their needs or questions without relying on specific URLs, AI can encourage more constructive and meaningful interactions. This approach promotes critical thinking and ensures that the AI's responses are based on a wide range of sources, enhancing the diversity and reliability of the information provided.\n\nIn summary, while your considerations touch on important aspects of copyright, fair use, and AI safety, the overarching principles guiding interactions with web content also include ethical use, information accuracy, and misuse prevention. These principles help ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly, in ways that respect copyright laws, promote safety, and foster constructive and beneficial interactions.",
