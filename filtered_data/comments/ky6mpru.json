    "body": "It really depends on the generator. Some of them have made leaps and bounds since gpt 4 first released.\n\nGpt Zero is one such tool. It used to be just as bad as all the others, but now its heuristic abilities can raise some serious questions on a pieces authenticity.\n\nFor example, it does standard ai detection, but also compares how similar this document is to others it has scanned. Most academic institutions can compare to other pieces directly, so if you did use AI, you will be caught for plagiarism.\n\nThat being said, if you truly didn\u2019t use ai, go in person and ask them to prove it to you. Have a discussion about the topic. If your teacher is sane, their concern will be with your understanding of material rather than origin of the paper. If they see that your understanding matches that of what you wrote, then they will likely stop inquiring",
