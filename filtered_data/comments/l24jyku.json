    "body": "It's always best to approach a situation like this assuming the best intentions from the other person. \n\nPut yourself in her shoes. She doesn't have to actually care about you, it would be less work for her to ignore it.  She wants to make sure that you actually know how to do the task, that you actually know the material that you're talking about.  This is the only reason she wants to make sure you aren't using AI.\n\nShe doesn't get a bounty for every student she fails for using AI. She's not going to be punished because a student submits a plagiarized assignment that she didn't notice. In fact, doing nothing about it is in her best interest, it would avoid conflict, and it would avoid having to have another meeting with you.\n\nSo the reason that she wants to meet with you is because she wants to make sure that you are actually able to do the work. Because it matters to her that the people she is teaching are actually learning what is being taught and not secretly falling behind while an AI hides it from evaluation. \n\nSo, knowing this, go into the meeting being thankful that she cares. Talk to her about how you put together the assignment, why you structured things the way you did, how you came up with certain things, what tools you used.  Work together with her to help understand why your paper was classified as AI generated, show her the tools that you used. Talk about the subject matter in the assignment in a way that you couldn't if you hadn't already done the work. Be interested and knowledgeable in the subject matter. I mean, this SHOULD be the result of the assignment, the general better understanding of the subject matter. \n\nShe doesn't want you to redo the whole assignment again. She wants you to have done the assignment once, and have learned what a person would have learned by doing the assignment.  So demonstrate that you've learned what you learned while doing the assignment, show how you've done the assignment.\n\nIf you are lying and you did actually generate it by AI, then you won't be able to demonstrate what you learned, because you wouldn't have learned anything since you hadn't done the assignment.",
