    "body": "This was not always the case. Because Chat GPT summarises any instruction you give to minimise the memory used for each conversation, it often changes things in the core instruction when you add a new command. When custom GPTs were first released, the way to govern this was to write everything on a text document and make changes to the master when you edited. However, as GPTs have increased in number, OpenAI in their wisdom stopped you from attaching text documents as instructions. As a result, you have no idea what GPT has removed when you add an edit and over multiple iterations you have no idea how much essential text it has chopped out. The result is MUCH poorer performing GPTs. Those I created initially are so much better because the core instruction remains as it was. New ones are a bloody nightmare and become generalised c\\*\\*p which is worse than iterative prompting from someone semi-capable in that process",
