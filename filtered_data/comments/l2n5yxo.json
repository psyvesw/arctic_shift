    "body": "Whether you want to admit it or not, it's just a matter of time before it's their world. AI is going to get infinitely better in the coming years and eventually have more knowledge than every human on earth. It will be able to solve every problem we have been unable to. It will be able to make better versions of itself and figure out solutions to every problem there is. Will it be used for good, bad, both? Will it eventually make its own decisions and turn against us? What the outcome of this may be is a story for another day.\n\nIn the meantime, it's perfectly natural to use AI for research and to gather facts. What do you think the new generation of people is going to use? Whether it should be doing the thinking for us or not, it is, and it will. If we are asking for 5 facts, it should give it to us.\n\nAvoiding politics is fine imo, but it's doing it because the people who created it are politically biased. It should be able to give us actual facts to any question we throw at it, and if there are none, it should say so.",
