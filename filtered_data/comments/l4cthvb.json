    "body": "The irony is that I don't like AI but whether I like it or not, it's still happening so I may as well try to steer the ship towards a direction I find more ethical while getting paid very well, but as I've discovered, there are \"sentinels\" out there that correct the course. By sentinels I mean, wads of money that are used as a reminder why their direction is better. As a warning for things to come, any company claiming that they want something done for ethical AI is outright lying. Their true motivation is to get rid of open source and put laws around video cards. Essentially monopolizing this space without a possibility of competitors to jump in and do what they do while trying to look righteous in the process. No fun allowed :(",
