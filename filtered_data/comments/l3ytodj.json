    "body": ">The moment someone claims you can have a conversation with gpt-4 like with any other human that of course extends to it answering like anyone with an IQ over 60.\n\nIt doesn't function like a human. Your expectations that we should have created a digital life form and have a living human existing on silicon is extremely unrealistic. You can't apply IQ to something that is not human, because that means it simultaneously has much higher IQ than any human on earth while also having lower IQ than a small child.\n\n>That means   not answering the question about fruits with \"un\" as an ending with \"papaya\".\n\nYou have no idea how it works at all, if you think it knows what letters are. That's like saying a calculator is dumb because it couldn't even sing Bohemian Rhapsody backwards.",
