    "body": "> Do people really buy books based on price?\n\nYes. More expensive books will be purchased less often by fewer people.\n\n>If artists can't afford pencils or paint, go get a job? \n\nArtists can't afford to make art because they have to divert their time, energy and money elsewhere. High quality art comes at the cost of many many many hours, days, months, years of practice and work. The less viable you make it as a career the fewer artists you'll have and the less real art will be produced.\n\n> It's not that expensive, as hobbies go. Art is as cheap as free to perform. \n\nIt's time expensive. One of the most time expensive things you could ever do. High quality materials and tools are also insanely expensive. And you keep saying \"hobby\", we're not just talking about hobbyists. Hobbyist art is typically not very good anyway, for the reasons I've already stated. When you don't allow people to live from their work they can't afford to learn how to or make good work.\n\n> Nobody's holding a gun to anybody's head saying 'Don't do art! Only AI!'. \n\nThat's exactly what they're doing. \"If you want to dedicate your life to making real art you will starve to death. Only AI art is marketable now. Stop making art and get a different job.\"\n\n>If you're only interested in profiting from your art, that's your problem.\n\nI'm only interested in making good art. I can't do that if I'm dead.\n\n>If you have no interest in doing art on your own time for your own amusement\n\nI wouldn't have time to make the same calibre of art. It's a full time job.\n\n>AI didn't do that. Capitalists didn't do that. You're the capitalist who decided there wasn't enough capital in it for you. You made that decision.\n\nVictim blaming. You really love licking that boot don't you.",
