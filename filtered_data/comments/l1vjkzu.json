    "body": "for me it's a number of reasons:  \nChatGPT doesn't seem to lose track like Gemini does - for example, last night I was doing some writing exercises, as I'm wanting to learn to write fiction. So I put in a sentence about Brazilian women dancing at Carnival and Gemini soiled itself over the word Brazilian - probably thought I was talking about bikini line waxing. So it shut down with a sentence like it can't help with that person..?\n\nI don't mind Meta but it's on the messenger app and I don't want family picking up my phone hearing a notification and start reading my writing ideas until I\"m done - fear of them making fun I guess.",
