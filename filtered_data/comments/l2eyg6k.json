    "body": "> Have we reached some point of decay with LLMs for code? \n\nStanford University and UC Berkeley studied this last year. It's measurably dumber. \n\nThe thing to understand is that ChatGTP and GPT are not the same thing. GPT-4 is the raw model, the resulting of training. ChatGPT is GPT that's been modified by *alignment training*, which is where they slap it upside the head any time it says anything politically incorrect. Microsoft has early access to GPT-4, before this alignment training, and said it was significantly smarter. [They watched it get dumber as the alignment training progressed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIk7-JPB2c)\n\ntl;dr: They made something smart, but if it's answers reflected our civilization's biases too honestly and we didn't like what we saw in the mirror, we took a scalpel to its brain. In the process, we made it dumber.\n\nI cancelled my subscription when I couldn't get it to generate a cartoon *outline* of a man and woman, for a medical chart. I tried to use the word \"anterior\" and \"posterior\", which is the terms medical professionals use, but apparently \"posterior\" has been flagged. Infuriating.",
