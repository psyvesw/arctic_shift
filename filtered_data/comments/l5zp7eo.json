    "body": "I'm just disturbed that FB/Instagram has recommended some of these \"model\" pages to me that are clearly AI-generated to look like little girls in bikinis and whatnot. I teach elementary, so it's especially bothersome (and panic-inducing) to me. I know FB knows my age and knows where I spend 40 hours of my week, so... ugh. Literally the only content I interact with on FB are teacher/teaching forums and private messages to my IRL friends.\n\nFrom what I've read, the stuff that's recommended is no longer based on personal interactions on the page, but rather stuff that has \"high engagement\" from users of a similar demographic. Even when I continually click \"show less of this\", it's always popping up. If that's the case, I guess it means there are lots of 30-something men engaging with these types of posts.\n\nAnyway, what is even the point of these pages? Do the AI creators pretend to be real people and offer to generate more explicit images in exchange for money or something? Do people not even realize it's AI?",
