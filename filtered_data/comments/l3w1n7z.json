    "body": "I mean it's clear what route they are going here. LLM's have existed for a while now, even more so with n-grams and statistics. But those don't really sound all that sexy to your average tabloid zine / VC people. So they call it \"A.I.\" Whether or not AGI will ever become a thing I'm leaving in the middle, I'm skeptic but cautiously curious. \n\nWould you call a very clever statistical model with access to a shitton of training and compute an intelligence? It still needs data, it still needs us. But at the same time, we as humans also learn by consuming new data -- so it's a bit of a grey zone I guess. Maybe \"the hivemind\" would have been a cooler name instead of \"A.I.\", but it would sound a bit more dystopian. I'm not a marketeer anyhow. \n\nThe real surprise here are the massive scales of computations that are now possible through cloud computing, which is a prerequisite for your average Joe being able to freely chat with these models. Moore's law has come to a bit of an end, so right now cloud computing and distributive loads across the loads based on consumption / energy are the future.",
