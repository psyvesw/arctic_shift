    "body": "Imagine such AI powered characters let loose on reddit pretending to be human, tenaciously standing their ground on the most idiotic, abrasive stances.   Imagine them not being swayed in the slightest even by the most clear, agreed upon, and obvious evidence.   Nothing anyone can say or do could make such a bot feel the slightest bit of shame or concede even the most minor points.   \n\n\n\nSuch a bot would \"win\" every argument against any human foolhardy enough to engage with it.  Of course to such a bot, as well as a disturbing number of humans, winning an argument means little more than getting the last word, preferably after eliciting an emotional response from it opponents.   The scary part is that even though such a win proves nothing, the repetitive false claims and the unwavering confidence in which they are made might sway undecided onlookers and bolster the confidence of believers of whatever disinformation they are propagating.  \n\n\n\nSome of the arguments I've been pulled into recently have me convinced that Reddit is lousy with such AI bots.   Their tell is how they can only seem to focus on one point at a time.  They don't build on things they said in previous comments, and will sometimes even kind of contradict things said earlier in the exchange.  They'll also drop a bunch of cherry picked paywalled articles as \"sources\".   Upon closer  inspection many of  their \"sources\" merely have a provocative headline that seems to support their position, but the article itself is either ambivalent and inconclusive, or sometimes even says the opposite of what they are claiming.  \n\nObviously these are all things humans are known for doing.  That makes sense because they are programmed to imitate humans.   It's hard to put your finger on what exactly is off, but it just doesn't feel right.   They go around in circles making logical leaps as if arguing with a child, but a child who actually does know everything instead of just thinking he does.   The thing is, even though these boys can access all of the information, they lack the context to clean the meaning from any of it.   They also lack the fear of being wrong and the shame that comes with it, which makes them able to say anything with the utmost confidence.   Scary times",
