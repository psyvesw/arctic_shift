    "body": "I think Gpt4 Turbo would be better for you than GPT 4o because of the quality over context size. Take a look at the image i added.   \n  \nGemini is better in a way that it has 2 milion tokens window (if you're not familiar, basicly you have the ability to chat with it for lets say 2milion characters while in GPT-4 only for about 256 thousand characters, but gemini seems to be less \"accurate?\" or less \"successfull\" in the tasks you give it.  \n  \nMany guys mistake this, but Copilot accually runs on the gpt-4 technology. It uses a bit different data and seems to have a sh1tty policy (personally Copilot never failed me so idk). Other than that Copilot can access web and internet, thats a great advantage, im telling you. With that you can create really crazy prompts that work like crazy. I know it might seem like I would be trying to sell you Copilot haha, but I have just used it the most :D\n\nI do not know much about Perplexity, but the main thing is that it works in more of a \"search\" tool. Like a search engine on steroids.\n\nI know that Claude is pretty nice too for it's paid model. You can research it a bit more. Im from Europe so I couldn't have tested it before hah.\n\nSummarising, go with what you think. I would just advice you to test and experiment. Try to use different tools and check which one works the best. For me I was using different models and somehow just sticked to Copilot. Have fun :D !",
