    "body": "Witchcraft and to a less extent it cousin's are not accepted religious and spiritual expressions in even secular society.\n\nWhile we do enjoy some degree of individual freedoms under the law.  Culturally we're still in the past about it.  And in some ways, yes the community has a major issue with frauds and crazies.  But so does literally EVERY community.  Witches/pagans/etc just often get zero benefit of the doubt.  In the eyes of the religious and the secular, we're helpless crazies guilty of wrong thinking. \n\nAs some one whose been semi-public in the past about my personal beliefs and attempted be a public facing member of my local community.  I had to back off because it started negatively effecting my career.  \n\nIt's disheartening, but I've come to accept how it is.  I've had my intelligence insulted, I've been threatened and accused of awful things based off a perception of my beliefs with out any of these people bothering to ask me what I actually believe/practice and why.\n\nSo the AI model doing this makes perfect sense to me.   There is a lot of negative stuff written about us from the religious right to the atheist community to even academia and psycology.   \nThat's Witchcraft,  it's not something you can speak publicly on and not expect some form of bigotry.  And no I highly doubt that'll change any time soon.",
