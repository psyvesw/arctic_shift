    "body": "The movie and performance are linked, not because of Johansson, but because of the capability of the technology she played. There's nothing emergent about celebrity voice fakes. I can listen to Plankton and Sandy Cheeks perform a metal duet on Youtube music right now. \n\nThe entire point is that interacting with the AI over audio has become dramatically more life-like. \n\nFurthermore, especially when it comes to media, when you are sued you take it down. If it's on a platform, the platform will take it down until the case is settled. It's not an admission of guilt, it's standard procedure. \n\nAs I stated in my other response, the entire goal is a more human like interaction with AI. So of course it's a \"copy\" of the movie Her because that's literally the plot of the movie. The question is whether they trained the data on Johansson's voice AND/OR if they tried to trick people into thinking it was her when it wasn't. We know for a fact that the latter is not true, so the only question is the former. Which, fair enough. Johansson has the right to ask the question. But if the answer is no then there's no case. \n\nYou don't need to be  lawyer to realize that if it's an entirely different voice actor AND the voice is an exact match to that actor's natural speaking voice then claiming it's an impersonation is unreasonable. Otherwise no voice actor that sounds like someone more famous than them would be able to work.",
