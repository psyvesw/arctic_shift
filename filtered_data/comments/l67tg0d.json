    "body": "The person I know who works in AI got a bachelors and a masters degree in computer engineering with a specialty in AI from a top engineering university. I lived with him while he was going through school, he studied grueling engineering and math problems for 12-16 hours per day every day for 7 years, and when he wasn\u2019t doing that, he was building his own apps for fun. \n\nIt always surprises me how people think they can just get into that field without that type of commitment of thousands and thousands of hours.",
