    "body": "Unfortunately it's years and years of research and growing up in South Africa during that period and taking notice how multinationals were making excuses to stay in the South African market.\n\nFor example ,Japan and Germany argued that divesting from South Africa(both countries had car manufacturing plants in the country) would only hurt mostly black workers who would be sitting without a job. \nJapan and Germany stated that the workers were well paid and that their families would be left destitute.\n\nGermany also funded an engineering school in a black neighborhood complete with very expensive heavy industrial machinery and brand new computers(which was still a rare piece of hardware in the 1980's).\n\nDoubt Chatgpt would have this knowledge.",
