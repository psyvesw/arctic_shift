    "body": "As a teacher, the problem is very few students would take the time to use a AI bot to figure something out they are struggling with. Most students don't even read the one sentence, simple directions to an assignment. Further, the ones that are struggling are the worst culprits of this.\n\nI provide the lost detailed rubric that perfectly outlines my expectations, review it with the students over and over, and still the students who actually need that guidance fail to apply it.\n\nNow I AM NOT SAYING don't even try to provide kids with the applications of AI you're listing above, but I am saying it's possible they are not going to be nearly as beneficial for the kids who actually need the support",
