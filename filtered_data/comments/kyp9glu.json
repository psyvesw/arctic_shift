    "body": "no worries in curiosity, the public models of chatgpt, what you can access, have cutoff dates to their training data. Every piece of text you see is a formula from the AI to arrange that word, and it happens through algorithms. GPT-4 is running from 2023 I think, it doesn't have any information beyond that date. That's the most fundamental thing to know about language models. \n\nSo when you get an output, that specific arrangement, what you read is math and words broken up to make readable text. The fact that it's accurate most of the time is why this tech is so important, we can learn exponentially faster than before when it's perfect.. but we aren't there yet, honestly..\n\nonce you learn the limitations you realize we're in a stage of AI progression that is exciting, yet lightyears still from science fiction. It's likely the rate of progression is also exponential so we'll cover ground fast, but there are challenges across the board. OpenAI is focusing on multimodal right now, blending text,speech, art, etc.. and building towards sophisticated AI.\n\nI'm focusing on this because I am genuinely interested, it's helped me learn a lot about what I want to do, ambition and potential.. and I like to always be learning, language and writing just happen to be my thing so it perfectly coincides with language models.",
