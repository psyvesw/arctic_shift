    "body": "Recently, I was watching a presentation in my college class, and the group presenting showed several PowerPoint slides. Instead of bullet points, they had an immense amount of text with bullet points. As I read, I had the sensation that it had been written by ChatGPT.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause of the excess of adjectives, the long paragraphs that all seemed to have the same lengths... but it was a particular phrase at the very end that made me certain. The phrase that, whenever I read it, I think, this phrase was generated by ChatGPT.\n\nThe phrase?\n\n\"left an indelible mark on the heart of Brazilian justice\"\n\nAn \"indelible mark\" and this tendency to want to romanticize.\n\nAnother phrase I saw in an email I received, which clearly shows it was generated by ChatGPT, is the classic \"I hope this message finds you well.\" It's not natural.\n\nThese were the ones I thought of.\n\nNow, to finish, since I'm not a native English speaker, I decided to translate this text with ChatGPT. It might be ironic to use it to answer a topic about which phrases or words immediately indicate that something was written by it, given the risk of a standard phrase or word appearing. But since I asked it to reproduce the style, tone, vocabulary, and voice with which I am writing, it might avoid that.",
