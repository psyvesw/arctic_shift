    "body": "This seems pretty impressive. Are you using claude Opus official app/webapp or the API, for those 200K context window sweet tokens?\n\n Also I'm a software engineering student but I had to stop for 4 years because of carpal tunnel so now I'm relearning a lot of Concepts and I mostly focusing on learning Technologies, Frameworks that seem to be very widespread nowadays like react, nodes.js, typescript, due to the immense increase of web and cloud computing relevance. I also would love to learn natural language processing, machine learning, calculus 3 (I had calculus 1 and 2 in college already) and statistics that might be required for these fields (only had statistics 1 in college).\n\n Aside from the math of calculus and stats, do you think that for learning with claude 3 is better than chatgpt4o? I am thinking about feeding it roadmap.sh for webdev, deep learning, etc etc.\n\n Of course these teachings would take months. I don't expect to become a pro lol, mostly looking to get solid foundations to pursue a master and a career in computer science with focus on data science and AI-related stuff, but meanwhile being able to do some cool webapps for personal use to aid my learning, since I am not a total beginner per se.\n\nVery interested in logic, philosophy and many of fields and the field roots of human knowledge and human cognition. I am finishing by bachelor next year and hoping to learn a lot this summer, as I am very exciting getting back :). Thank you! I used voice-to-text, I am sorry for any possible mistakes.",
