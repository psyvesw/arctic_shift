    "body": "I agree. However, it's highly possible that we soon realize that we don't need to know how to spell or how to put the words in the correct order, or be concerned with the structure of written language. In fact as u/lordcardbord82 implied, we should probably consider taking the calculator analogy seriously. \n\nI mean, if you can let a handheld computer the size of a cookie explain any human generated content in a custom way that's appropriate for your needs in the matter of seconds... Why would anyone be expected to put time and effort into writing? I mean, you shouldn't expect anyone to read what you actually wrote. You could just randomly scribble a few lines here and there, speak something into your wall, think something into the thought extractor and then ask the dishwasher to publish your ideas and a few moments later someone speaking a different language and living in a different culture could perfectly understand what you wanted to tell the world. You won't even have to learn another language than the language your parents speak. We don't need to understand someone else's language to be able to understand their thoughts. Personally I think we're better off avoiding language as a means for direct communication of important ideas. We're simply not motivated enough to understand each other. That's AI's job. Language currently creates more problems than it solves.",
