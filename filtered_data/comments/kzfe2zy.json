    "body": "I wouldn\u2019t call this exchange a debate. It is more of a Q&A or conversation. I suggest if you want to get better responses you do some research into Prompt Engineering. There\u2019s a science to getting useful responses out of ChatGPT. While the data it is trained on is typically a year behind present day, you can still prompt it if you give it details. You can\u2019t just tell it that OJ died and expect it to take your word for it and remember that as gospel. But you can provide it links to credible sources reporting he is dead and upload the obituary proving he is dead. The paid version is much more thorough and can analyze larger blocks of text and read large document uploads. It does not have opinions but it can give you a more precise answer (prediction which is as close to an opinion as it will give) if you prompt it appropriately.",
