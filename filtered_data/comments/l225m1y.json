    "body": "I used ChatGPT yesterday to take care of a boring skilless task. I had a PDF page in front of me with the latest education sector ILR codes arranged in tables. I wanted to create a comma separated list of all values, one row of values per heading. I couldn't easily copy/paste the tables of data because the tables were in a two-column page layout, and selecting text was picking up the rows across the page, not collated by heading. So, I took a screenshot of each table, fed it that with the prompt, giving an example of a heading and a value and how I wanted that data formatted into a list of comma-separated values that each contained the abbreviated header... it handled the task like a charm,  flawless. A boring 15 minute job done in 1.\n\nI also used it to consume a wordy bunch of terms and conditions and tell me what I needed to worry about, mitigate, and discuss with the client. It not only pulled out the bits I may need to be prepared to cover with my daily rates, it also pulled up what limits and caps I should ask to agree on to ensure the agreement was mutually beneficial, and where anything could be misinterpreted. I skimmed through the doc myself in case it was inventing or missing something, but it was spot on and gave me advice I wouldn't have considered even reading it in depth solo.\n\nThis does not replace my understanding of system integrations or engineering enterprise software, but it really helps with the stuff I shouldn't have to spend a long time on. I'm better able to get on with solving real problems for people.",
