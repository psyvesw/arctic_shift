    "body": "Use logic here. What do we want to achieve? I'd say reduction in children abused. Well currently there is a demand we have been unable to stamp out for sexual images of children. Those images are worth a lot of money. There's a huge market for them. The reason we don't allow them is because they involve harm done to children.\n\nIf  we allow ai generated CP what will happen to real CP? It will become less valuable as it's replaced by cheap easy and legal alternatives, that, importantly, do not involve any victims.\n\nSo allowing AI generated CP will greatly reduce the victimisation of children for the production of CP.\n\nBut of course hardly any of the people that claim to be doing this for the children, actually care about the children. Otherwise they'd support the only logical measure that will reduce real harm and suffering of said children.\n\nProof? Watch my vote count.",
