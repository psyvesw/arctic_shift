    "body": "It wouldn\u2019t be capable of doing what OP asked, even with that additional feature. The sample size would be too low to represent the internet as a whole, as it only grabs a few pages to parse.\n\nThe person you replied to is basically just explaining why this doesn\u2019t work for a regular GPT- GPTs don\u2019t keep counts in their models, only probabilities. It\u2019s not like, \u201cI found george washington mentioned 17274766621 times\u201d, it\u2019s saying \u201cthe probability of george washington being the next two words in this sentence is higher than anything else\u201d. So a poll is not going to work with base functionality, either.\n\nEven if it did, parsing the internet for opinion data is, in an academic sense, stupid as fuck. You are just introducing a million biases you do not need. The data will be flat out wrong, especially with contentious queries.",
