    "body": "Right, so I see your argument, but why shouldn't prospective artists have to pay for the pictures they look up on google images for reference then? They may even sell that art.\n\nThe reason we have plagiarism laws is so that nobody can take someone else's work and pass it off ass their own, not to prevent students from learning without permission. If I take some free educational courses, I might put someone who actually paid for school out of a job, would that be unethical?\n\nIMO the difference lies in the originality of the final product, not in your permission to benefit from something. Plagiarism is about copying other people's work without modifying it to take credit. If I handed you a copy of a book I own so you could read it, that's not plagiarism as long as I didn't claim to write it, and the author of the book definitely doesn't have any claim to any ideas you came up with because you read the book. In the same vein, generative AI is taking this data the same way a human would, \"i.e. reading\" and modifying it into something completely new.",
