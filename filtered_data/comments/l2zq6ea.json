    "body": "> Because you cannot solve a problem requiring a posterior knowledge if you only have a priori knowledge. \n\nOf course you can't - that has nothing to do with anything. You can't tell me whether it's raining outside either if you don't step outside and take a look.  If LLMs could not take in knowledge input then your point would be exactly correct, but of course that's not even vaguely true - it's virtually their defining feature.\n\nSo there's three options here:\n\n1) You knew that and were just hoping I wouldn't call you on it. \n\n2) You know what \"a posterior\" knowledge is but somehow didn't know that taking in information and responding to it is exactly what an LLM does.\n\n3) You have no idea what \"a posterior\" knowledge is and were just using big words on the theory that if you don't know what they mean no one else does either. \n\nI'm going to be honest here - none of those options show any future for this conversation whatosever, so I think we're just going to bring it to a close here.
