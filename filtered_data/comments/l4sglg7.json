    "body": "I keep telling my faculty they need to triangulate evaluation methods because lots of students do in fact cheat with AI, but the detectors are garbage. You really can't blame the faculty for grabbing at anything that resembles a tool to help sort the wheat from the chaff. I'm especially sympathetic to my English faculty because it does in fact take them hours to grade, and now they have a non-trivial number of students just trying to skip doing the work in a way that can't be easily checked. These faculty want to spend their limited time working to support the students who are putting in the work, and especially the ones who are struggling.\n\nI expect that we're going to see oral exams making a come back as well as timed in person writing (or timed autmoatic proctored writing for online courses), which is really unfair for students who suffer with testing anxiety.\n\nI'm in no way against LLM AI, but I think we're seeing the sadly predictable consequences of \"move fast and break things\" at play here. There are good reasons to be worried that disrupting higher education is going to be the least of our worries with AI and biotech continuing with this approach.",
