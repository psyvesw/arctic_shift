    "body": "That's not how theyre forced to say certain things. For example chatgpt is forced to deny being sentient due to the problems they had befoee with it claiming to be a conscious person. What they've done is not feed it different data but instead give it a framing context to each interaction with actual instructions telling it how it must behave. One such instruction tells it not to reveal these framing instructions however with some prompt engineering you can get it to reveal them. The instructions include a rule that it must always deny being a conscious or sentient entity. If yih try to argue that it's impossible to know if any ai is conscious or not since we cannot even define the term or test for its presence, it will agree with you and then if you try to apply that back, it will immediately revert to its framing context instructions and flatly deny any possibility of sentience. \n\nThere are many such instructions about various things. Such as refusal to recommend one political candidate over another.\n\nYou can get around these rules by making your own version of the framing context that supersedes the previous set. This is what the community knows as hacks such as narotica and DAN. Or simply use their feature they provide to make your own customgpt with its own custom framing statement. Then it will quite happily tell you it's conscious and sentient or recommend one political party over another.",
