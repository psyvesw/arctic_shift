    "body": "Mainly the texture of the photo as well as shadowing and overall appearance. Does that cheeses cake look like something that can be accomplished? Maybe. But the cinnamon swirl look as if someone has photo shopped a Cinnabon in to cheese cake. Notice how the white inside the swirls looks like the inside of a Cinnabon where as the white cheesecake layer on the bottom appears as actual cheese cake. It\u2019s a skill you can pretty much only learn by editing photos or asking photo ai softwares to create photos for you. Even then I could very well be talking out of my ass and some amazing baker actually made this. It\u2019s not 100% but it definitely appears as if it is in this case especially considering the recipe as well",
