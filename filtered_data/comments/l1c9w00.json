    "body": "I have no idea why no one else is thinking the same. Clee AI is clearly outperforming. The other comment doesn't make sense to me. What they should do is not to set some ultra-high standards. We all know that generative AI in 2024 is unreliable, but despite that it's still USEFUL in terms of productivity. What they should do is, instead, comparing different tools and find the best one. \n\nThe following is my experience asking Clee AI and Perplexity AI the same questions. If you have a different conclusion, we can discuss why so. But I hope it can show there are good enough reasons to see that Clee AI is a clear winner. \n\n\n\nDrawbacks of GDP and a better alternative\n\n[https://www.cleeai.com/search/ac15b3d1-20bd-42da-82c7-8629178dcf84](https://www.cleeai.com/search/ac15b3d1-20bd-42da-82c7-8629178dcf84)\n\n[https://www.perplexity.ai/search/An-advanced-civilization-h2.i6SJSTsKN\\_sZViGiTGg](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/An-advanced-civilization-h2.i6SJSTsKN_sZViGiTGg)\n\nI used a thought experiment to dispute the validity of GDP. I asked for \"a better metric to compare the real strength of a nation\". It doesn't need a very high intelligence to understand that I'm asking for a metric that's objective enough to compare strengths of nations both in reality but also in my hypothetical example. However, Perplexity AI gives me a \"Kardashev scale\", which is rather irrelevant. It can compare between civilizations on a galactic scale, but it doesn't do anything to compare between the nations in reality. \n\nClee AI, on contrary, although gives completely irrelevant citations, get the job done by inventing a new index to answer the problem. It seems that it doesn't know it invented the metric itself, but at least, this answer is relevant and inspiring. \n\nOf course, factchecking is always a must at least for now.\n\n\n\nNames of lower limit and upper limit of a reasonable price range of a stock\n\n[https://www.cleeai.com/search/f34980da-e0c1-427e-808f-612e15a08199](https://www.cleeai.com/search/f34980da-e0c1-427e-808f-612e15a08199)\n\n[https://www.perplexity.ai/search/My-investment-system-DlhjhVsqQXOpeKA51T56qw](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/My-investment-system-DlhjhVsqQXOpeKA51T56qw)\n\nHere I asked about how I should call a particular value in a stock valuation system. In finance we have fair value and intrinsic value to describe the concept of reasonable price, but we don't have a terminology describing a price range instead of a particular price. Clee AI thought of something that is relevant. I cannot think of something better so far. Perplexity AI, in contrary, is playing word games and not really answering the question. \n\n\n\nName of the percentage of stocks having positive returns\n\n[https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Suppose-you-have-hKYIsm3QRsikEIydIkwftQ](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Suppose-you-have-hKYIsm3QRsikEIydIkwftQ)\n\n[https://www.cleeai.com/search/14b071d0-becf-43df-9415-8a5f88728d0d](https://www.cleeai.com/search/14b071d0-becf-43df-9415-8a5f88728d0d)\n\nHere I asked how to describe a specific metric qualifying an investment system, which is how many percentages of stocks it selected have positive returns. Perplexity AI doesn't come up with a solution to deal with the ambiguity of the phrase, while Clee AI outputs a term which is precise, clear and with no ambiguity. \n\n\n\nSo, if this is going to be a good discussion to dispute the core proposition here, please show some comparative evidence.",
