    "body": "I don't understand what's going on here. 4o is just about unusable for me. It ignores most of what I say and simply cannot produce functional code. I've been trying to use it every day since release, and at this point, I always have to go back to Claude. Whatever happened has affected 4 for me in the same way as well. Before 4o, I'd use Claude and ChatGPT 4 about equally. Now, I have to use Claude almost exclusively.\n\n  \nIt's like they have different configurations for different users. I can't stress this enough: it is *unusable* for me, and simply refuses to answer ANY question I ask unless I explicitly instruct it to answer the question. Even then, it often ignores me and does its own thing. I have no memories or custom instructions.\n\n  \nIt's very frustrating that so many people here are denying that this is happening to some people.",
