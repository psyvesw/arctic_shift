    "body": "well, the AI write pretty well... so if you also write well, it might sound like AI and get flagged by one of these BS detectors.\n\nthe only way they could really prove you used AI is if you left some phrase in your work like \"As an AI assistant, here is the conclusion you requested:\". The other way they could get you is by looking at previous essays and comparing them to this one. If you wrote like crap for a few years, and then all of a sudden handed in a paper with a really good writing style, it would be unlikely that you able to improve your writing that drastically, that quickly. \n\nbut ya, otherwise the AI detectors aren't really reliable. perhaps bringing in work from previous years before AI was available to the public, and showing similar writing styles would help your case. if their only evidence is the score from Turnitin or software like that, then you're dealing with morons who know nothing... but that's probably not uncommon in higher education these days.",
