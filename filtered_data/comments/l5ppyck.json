    "body": "I believe all AI tools should be uncensored and free to use for anything. \n\n1) with regards to blackmail or deepfakes of real people. I believe that videos created with real people should be allowed completely, even if some people could make humiliating or horrible things with real people or blackmail/misinformation. I think that society just has to learn to deal with it and learn to ignore the bad things generated. Maybe getting law enforcement or school authorities involved if children are bullied by them to punish the student responsible Or if an adult is running a scam to be arrested. But otherwise it should be allowed because if it was banned then it would destroy the full creative freedoms of individuals who want to use real people to created light hearted videos or movies with real people in them. \n\n2) with regards to ai generated cp videos although it is still disturbing and the people who are into them are messed up people. I believe that it should not be restricted because unlike with real cp real children were not harmed in making them and they only carry the likeness of children, it is no longer highly immoral in the same way. In order to ban this content entirely effectively you would have to ban all NSFW even with adults which would again destroy the full creative liberties of the tools. And I am anti-pornography personally And I would recommend all people not to view or generate pornography in any form, but I still believe that creative freedom should be maintained.",
