    "body": "Without a degree in math or pure science, I have had the nerve, for several years, to plunge into the most basic views of reality and causality. I wrote a blog [thethirdmillennium.com](http://thethirdmillennium.com) \"Reality in Three Paradigms\" about basic knowledge of causality like \"Exclusive Determinism\" (proven false) vs a combination of Exclusive Determinism combined with Emergence/Self Organization. The latter created all life and all that follows - consciousness, free will, culture, religion, etc. I wanted ChatGPT to confirm the broad mathematical, scientific and logical ratification of this view and all its astounding ramifications. - It understood the entire question and implied complications, broad as they are, and organized an answer that was completely responsive. I pressed further questions about the implications of The Three Body problem and the implication that a completely deterministic result is simply impossible in real life, even down to the level of three molecules interacting, because of the pervasiveness of non-linear effects (ambient artifacts) that would always destroy a pure deterministic effect because it needs the purity and isolation of a computer-like environment. I criticized some of its first, hedging answers and it answered in with appropriate way that seems to indicate a consciousness of itself several times. If that isn't enough, no one completely knows how it works!",
