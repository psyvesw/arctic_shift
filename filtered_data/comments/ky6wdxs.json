    "body": "> Citation needed.\n\nTake an econ 101 course. \n\n> Shitty cheap self-published digital amazon books sell next to nothing.\n\nLmao. No they don't. Why do you think there are so many of them? They cost little to produce and are cheap enough that they sell. If they didn't no one would be making them.\n\n>I have a job too, I still have time to perform my art and fund my expensive hobbies\n\nNot well. Not to a high standard. Which is why you're a hobbyist that buys commissions and needs to use AI. Real art takes a lot more time than that.\n\n>I mean, that's already the case?\n\nNo. Art is one of the world's largest industries. It employs hundreds of millions of people full time in all sectors. You really don't know anything about it do you?\n\n>Then don't die of starvation and homelessness.\n\nAnd how do I do that? By doing a job that isn't art. So I stop producing art or vastly decrease my output and the quality of my work. Great. Enshittification.\n\n>Choose not to be a victim\n\nI will. By fighting this dumbing down and capitalist cock sucking one moron at time. Starting with you.",
