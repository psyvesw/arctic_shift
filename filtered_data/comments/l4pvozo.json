    "body": "I started writing a response and it turned into a essay, so thanks for your response, it engaged me and helped me focus my viewpoint a bit.\n\n>Firstly define lazy and yourself why are people lazy?\n\nI'd define laziness as choosing the path of least resistance even when knowing other paths will lead to better outcomes. Sure, I *could* go to the gym and work out and I know that will be healthy and probably make me more fulfilled with my day, but I could also *not* do that, sit on the couch, watch netflix all day... Our brain's reward systems are essentially hotwired to take easy and quick gratification over long-term fulfillment. \n\n>My conclusion is that modern \"laziness\" is in reality post nihilism and wide spread depression due to abhorrent material conditions.\n\nWhile I agree that it's partially a modern problem, I'd say thay's because society (ie, capitalism) has simply gotten better at exploiting that part of our biology, but it was always there to begin with. \n\n>Humans, psychologically, aim to produce and set goals, why else would laziness be a negative term if not to describe a behavior opposed to the expected one. Even this is putting it crudely. \n\nThis I agree with, but at the same time we must acknowledge also that humans can have a lot of trouble with *following through* on their goals. In part because of what I've written above, in part because a lot of people don't know how to effectively achieve their goals.\n\n>Then ask yourself, where do those kids come from, why the differing behavior? I surmised those who use AI to accelerate their personal growth either were raised in good conditions thus adopted healthier behaviors as humans or were raised in bad conditions and must use their intelligence as a \"a way out\".  \n\nAs someone who works in education (physics teacher), environment is definitely a big factor, but even for the kids with all the things going the \"right way\" we see a ton of avoidant behavior and taking the easy way out.\n\nI'd have to remark that it's not a universal thing. Some people are much more susceptible to this kind of behavior than others, and I think there's reasons for that both societal and biological, nature and nurture.\n\nI think in the long term AI could definitely help make humanity as a whole more intelligent but on the short term, t's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. We're going to have a whole generation where a big portion is used to coasting by without any effort at all.",
