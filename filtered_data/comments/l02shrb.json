    "body": "I'll give you the example that caused me to post this earlier. I wanted it to generate a picture of a Mexican man creepily looking at a small white man with blonde hair. My friends wanted a comparison between our real photo and what AI was capable of. Of course, it refused. I asked over and over again to no avail. There was no racial connotation to this, it was just based on a real photo we had, but to chatGPT it was offensive. \n\nClearly the politically correct hive mind doesn't seem to think it's a problem, but I do.",
