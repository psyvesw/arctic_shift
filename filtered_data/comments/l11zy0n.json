    "body": "Yeah these are the issues we are facing currently. Of course things don't go smoothly at all when trying to implement these changes, especially considering that we have to work with 25 children to get these things done. I definitely am really passionate about the potential benefits of AI and LLMs in schools and am trying to push my school towards shifting our focus there. The system is extremely rigid though sadly and a little teacher like myself sadly does not have much power in changing the system but I am starting on building a network of like minded teachers and am hopeful that all of this is still so new we still have a chance to shape things at least a little bit. Not even concerned about any raises though. I really do feel like this will be a game changer for students and teachers alike and could solve sooooooo many issues we have been talking about for years. The proper tools (and money to develop them) just have to find their way into the school system. I am sure it is only a matter of time.",
