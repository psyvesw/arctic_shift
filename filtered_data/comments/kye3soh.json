    "body": "ChatGPT 3.5 circa October '23 generated excellent boilerplate code, provided pretty darn good code reviews, and in general was a great developer's assistant.  Saved me tons of time and brought me up to speed on WPF in a hurry.\n\nI rarely use ChatGPT 4.0 now because usually it's usually faster to write something myself than to coax it to stop inventing fictitious functions and generating code that's utterly haywire.  It often seems to forget what it had been doing halfway through, so I'll get 20 lines of reasonable code and 20 more devoid of any clear intent.\n\nI also find that when I point out deficiencies in what it generates and ask it to try again, it'll apologize, generate exactly the same thing, then announce it's all better.  This can go on for several cycles.\n\nI've also noticed that it loses track of my custom instructions within maybe half a dozen prompts, so I keep having to start new conversations so it can remember the basics to which I want it to adhere.\n\nI also used to use it to generate Spanish quizzes, which I'm trying to learn.  That isn't useful anymore, because now it randomly marks things correct or incorrect without regard for reality.\n\nFinally, it has the MOST FUCKING ANNOYING HABIT of, upon being told why what it generated was wrong, regurgitating that back as if it were helping me understand why what it had generated was wrong.\n\nI could go on at length, but you get the point.",
