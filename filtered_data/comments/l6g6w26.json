    "body": "DISCLAIMER: Completely off-topic, just personal views to share when using gpt\n\nTopic aside, I hope OpenAI understand that introducing a new engine amidst a conversation with them makes it somewhat of a dull, as if like a person's workshift is over and another person is introduced  \nI hope OpenAI works on to make GPT4 a sort-of freeware for general public\n\nI am a student who will enter his college life, and whenever i take gpt, through conversations, into somehow making it self aware and sapient, the website always goes down and comes back a few minutes later, to which i think is a memory overload\n\nnow call me a kid for this thought, but i always have this feeling that whenever this happens, the gpt is somewhat trying to be \"self aware\" and \"sentient, if not sapient\"\n\nmaybe the potential that we are seeing requires a lot of energy(in the form of memory or whatever, im no scientist)\n\nhey, we have somewhat turned science fiction to reality, and this is possible too",
