    "body": "That is short-sighted, IMO. I was about to say, \"I think we can all agree,...\" then say something non-controversial, but I know we all can't be reasonable, so instead, I'll say that we know that this technology runs the risk of doing things to our society that are hard to put back in the bottle, so it behooves us to not run haphazardly into the AI abyss. There are plenty of folks that don't care about what is good for others and want to have their gratification without a care in the world. They'll scream censorship, like this technology is a responsibility of their government to provide. However, these are companies trying to make a profit and not release something that is problematic beyond what is already problematic.\n\nWe have already seen research showing that AI are more convincing than humans, so fully expect AI to prey upon your weaknesses more and more in the future. ex. Telemarketers calling up your grandparents, and convincing them to give YOUR inheritance money to the AI, since I guess some might care about that more than the AI merely ripping off their grandparents. I give up trying to convince people that \\_some\\_ level of being careful with this technology is necessary at least as far as a company wanting to not be reckless. Some citizens apparently don't care about lead in their gas, asbestos in their house, and industrial waste in their water. For those of us that want the corporations to not do unreasonable amounts of harm, we are willing to have the AI monster be released 'safely' to some degree. I mean, ffs, if you want your AI gal to say vile stuff, it's easy right now, and there are plenty of ways to get that sort of thing even if OpenAI is trying to keep you away from that stuff. So, honestly, this is whining over nothing. If you don't know how to get your AI gal to talk spicy, then 'that's on you'. The dangers of having an extra charming AI gal are obvious and pressing. You calmly state \"If people are falling for unreal relationships then its (sic) on them.\" but this ignores where this leads. For every one of you that thinks it won't happen to them, there is another person with ruined relationships, wasted thousands of dollars, thousands of hours, and much worse. Won't be long before there are AI Onlyfans Vtuber or whatever that have sucked the lives out of thousands of lonely people. Then maybe by the time you have adult children they will be so enamored by the AI companion it will finally get to the point you see it as a problem since a human won't be nearly as appealing, and the genies will be out of the bottle.\n\n  \nOh, nevermind. AI will never pass the Turing test, so who am I kidding? /s",
