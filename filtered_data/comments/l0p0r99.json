    "body": "I think ChatGPT is essentially answering your questions in the most literal sense. Is it possible that someone who is narcissistic could also be stalking you? ChatGPT is going to say yes because of course most things are possible. When you ask real people with knowledge of the subject and in person experiences, they are going to be have more opinion based answers. Personally, I would take ChatGPT's opinion with a grain of salt. I'd be more inclined to listen to experienced professionals. Especially when it comes to something as nuanced as human behavior.",
