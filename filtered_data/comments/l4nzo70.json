    "body": "Prompts ChatGPT gave to dalle:\n\nA detailed diagram comparing USB2 and USB3 cables and ports. The diagram should clearly label and show: 1. A side-by-side comparison of the cable cross-sections, highlighting the thickness and internal wiring differences. USB2 cable should be labelled with 4 wires, minimal shielding. USB3 cable should be labelled with 9 wires, enhanced shielding for reduced signal interference. 2. An overhead view comparing the USB2 and USB3 ports, indicating the number of pins: 4 for USB2, 9 for USB3, with annotations explaining the purpose of the additional pins in USB3. The diagram should be technical, clear, and educational, suitable for understanding the physical and functional differences.\n\n\nAnd\n\n\nCreate an artistic representation of two robots, designed to resemble USB connectors from the previous diagram. Robot 1 should mimic the USB2 connector: simpler design, fewer details, representing the 4-pin structure. Robot 2 should mimic the USB3 connector: more complex and detailed design, reflecting the 9-pin structure with additional elements that suggest enhanced capabilities. Both robots should have a metallic, futuristic appearance, with elements that subtly hint at their inspiration from USB technology, positioned in a dynamic, friendly pose.\n\n\nTried to get a conversation link but it gives me an api error \ud83e\udd37",
