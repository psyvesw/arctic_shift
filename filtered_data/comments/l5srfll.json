    "body": "I'm conflicted on how to view it.\n\nThinking for sure no, but reasoning is more tricky.\n\nThey can do a lot of things than certainly seem like reasoning and meet various definitions of reasoning even if the underlying process is different. For example their ability to apply ethical or moral judgments to novel circumstances, or take two concepts and combine  them together and provide predictions.\n\nThey don't have consciousness, and they don't make 'internal models of possible futures' like we do.They are based on statistical probability.\n\nBut still...\n\nThere is like an emergent reasoning capacity in there somewhere. Sometimes to a degree it seems silly NOT to attribute them with at least some reasoning ability. \n\n\n-----\n\nA second argument is that perhaps it doesn't even matter how the underlying process works. \n\nPerhaps an appearance of reasoning skills that's accurate enough to be indistinguishable from conscious reasoning should just be treated the same anyway.\n\nA broken clock is right twice a day. LLM reasoning is like the clock is still broken, but there is someone so incredibly good at counting seconds accurately they can manually update the clock hands every half second and the clock stays broken but still shows the correct time.\n\nI don't have any clue or access or control or even awareness of how the majority of my unconcious/subconscious mind works. Why did I choose this for breakfast instead of that? I could make up a reason but the truth is I didn't choose, the unconscious part fed the answer to me \n\n * I prompted 'I want breakfast, what should I eat\"\n\n* My brain considered things and replied 'toast'",
