You are trolling; or just don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\n\nHere are some materials and their sources from some industry experts so you can go ahead and educate yourself:\n\nDr Hazel Bradshaw - quotes \u201c\u2026.is intelligent in a very particular way\u2026 and that it generates human-like text based on patterns from its training data, but it does not reason like a human\u201d\n\nSource\nhttps://datacom.com/au/en/discover/articles/fast-but-flawed-the-pros-and-cons-of-chatgpt\n\nMIT experts have excerpts that also come to the same conclusion - that ChatGPT is generative and makes stuff from being trained on massive amounts of data - it can\u2019t come up with new stuff on it\u2019s own.\n\nDevavrat Shah from MIT literally said talking about ChatGPT - \u201cGenerative AI models tend to be outperformed by traditional machine-learning methods for tasks that involve making predictions on structured data,\u201d \n\nIf this isn\u2019t black and white for you - Time to go back to school! His words show the limitations of generative AI like ChatGPT and reinforce its classification as narrow AI. AGI would suggest it is on par with human consciousness. Basically every expert on the subject confirms that ChatGPT is not AGI or anywhere near it.\n\nhttps://alum.mit.edu/slice/mit-experts-share-insights-ai-impacts\n\nSources\n\nhttps://scitechdaily.com/beyond-human-mit-experts-explain-generative-ai-and-the-chatgpt-phenomenon/\n\nhttps://alum.edu/slice/mit-experts-share-insights-ai-impacts\n\nThere ya go, the experts disagree with you. \ud83e\udd42\n\n\n\n\nFrom ChatGPT itself (for kicks and giggles - \n\n\u201cChatGPT and its predecessors (GPT-3, GPT-4) are sophisticated language models trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like responses. However, these models are limited to the capabilities defined by their training and design, and do not possess general intelligence. OpenAI explicitly states that their goal is to develop safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence (AGI), but current models like ChatGPT are still within the realm of narrow AI\u201d",
