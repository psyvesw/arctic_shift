    "body": "Gonna say right here that there is indeed no way to \"prove it\", but that there are plenty of ways to still OP a 0 on his assignment/thesis/paper/... . \n\nCurrently checking AI usage for a student's thesis. It doesn't matter if students use AI (why wouldn't you use it, you use Microsoft spell check for helping you write, don't you?), but it matters how they use it. Asking ChatGPT \"write me a thesis paragraph on this topic\" and copy pasting it word for word is going to get you a fail grade whether they can prove it's AI or not. This student of mine has a full chapter in the wrong format with 0 working sources and references.   \n  \nAnother student I failed because their interview transcripts were faked using ChatGPT. I wouldn't care if he had just used AI to help him write them down, but the transcripts do not match the supposed conclusion at all, it's obviously faked (and if it wasn't faked, then his conclusion wouldn't make sense according to his research either way).\n\nAlso failed a student for business writing class once because they handed me a resume and cover letter written by ChatGPT. Again, you can do this, no way for teachers to prove it's AI, but when the text contains \"I would be a great employee at your company because I have many skills and talents that are employable for a company such as yours\", I'm not going to bother reading it anyway. You already failed the assignment.\n\nExample of a student who did make good usage of AI on their thesis: basically wrote the entire thing using AI, but personally adjusted the information of every paragraph and inserted the correct APA references. Basically just had all of the correct information, all of the necessary elements, but realised he sucked at writing and asked the bot to fix the writing gaps for him.",
