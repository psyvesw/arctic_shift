    "body": "Is this really ok ? selling a service but not clearly saying what is in this service\n\nI've checked everywhere, there is no mention of any limit anywhere in the terms of use or subscription page, there is a vague hint on GPT Team, where is say \"higher message cap on GPT4\" but it say nothing more, and nothing either under GPT Plus, it just say \"access to GPT4\"\n\nYou are told of this limit, only when you've already paid, but even then it only say \"limit may apply\", the real limit you only know it when you reach it\n\nI've never heard of a company selling you a product or providing a service but deciding randomly and without telling your first, the quantity you receive  \nImagine Netflix saying : \"Sometime we may decide that you only get to watch your shows at some random hours and only a random number of episodes, and of course you don't know when it is or how much you can watch until you reach the limit.\" ( don't get any bad idea netflix ! )\n\nI'm not a law expert at all and might be completely wrong, feel free to destroy my arguments if you know your subject, but for me it make no sense that a company would be allowed to sell subscription contract where what you get in return isn't clearly disclosed when your sign the contract\n\nI'm wondering if this isn't illegal in some part of the world, probably Europe\n\nAnyway, legal or not I really think they need to disclose the limit somehow, just for user comfort, I prefer to know in advance that I only get 10 messages today and simply do something else instead, rather and starting something on GPT4 and hitting the limit after 10 messages when I was planing to do a lot of stuff and was hopping for at least 50",
