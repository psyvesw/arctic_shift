    "body": "I think students who are using advanced models like the paid ChatGPT, as a tutor not for cheating, would disagree with you.\n\nEvery time someone shits on how the models work, rather than whether they\u2019re effective, I can\u2019t help but think your take is irrelevant.\n\nI have personally used all the major LLM models since ChatGPT dropped in late 2022, through more than 20 college classes, and as a mentor/reference when programming. It\u2019s MIND BLOWING how helpful it\u2019s been. I don\u2019t care how it works or if someone who\u2019s not benefiting from it thinks it\u2019s dumb, the real world practical effect is that it\u2019s faaaaar better than a tutor 90% of the time, and 90% as good as a tutor the other 10% of the time. For $20/mo, with infinite patience, 24/7, and it does motivate you and hold you accountable if you learn to prompt it correctly.",
