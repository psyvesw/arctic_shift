    "body": "First, check your schools AI policy. Many don\u2019t even have a formal policy in place - if that\u2019s the case, this entire argument holds no water. The irony is that your prof used AI to \u201ccheck\u201d if you did. Secondly, Grammarly Pro\u2019s recommended edits are AI driven - if you used that along with your own writing, that is totally acceptable unless it was explicitly called out by your school /prof.\n\nDon\u2019t lie about where you used AI, even if just to edit. Be polite but firm in your responses to your prof.\n\nYou have to remember that we\u2019re at a crossroads with AI being another tool that\u2019s available. Profs and schools are nervous, overwhelmed, and unsure how to adjust old ways to what is a new paradigm. This is no different an argument than one day laptops became a thing and you could now type and edit documents vs handwriting them out. Then the internet become a thing and we didn\u2019t have to actually sift through books physically. \n\nAI is just the next set of tools that will be available at school, the workplace, etc. Be polite, respond promptly and stand your ground.",
