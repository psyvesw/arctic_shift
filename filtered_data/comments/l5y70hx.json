    "body": "I literally just spent the whole day installing, fixing, working around and eventually getting it running with [AllTalk](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/releases/tag/1.9c). I'm not even kidding, my mind has been blown today with what people have manged to achieve with their coding and skills. I've manged to get things to the point im using Llama-3-8B-Q4\\_K\\_M as a model and alltalk trained on my own voice (70% of the way there, not bad but I want Sky from ChatGPT lol).\n\nI've had SO many random problems along the way (I believe VC 2015 runtimes/files was the worst for compiling AllTalk). But eventually I got there, and I NEVER would have done it without your post! I'm actually autistic and I have trouble getting started on things but once someone points me in the right direction I loose myself fast. Your post was just crazy how much info you threw at me, it was amazing and this is blowing my mind. \n\nWhat really messes me up is that I'm using almost basic options for everything, I have no idea what most of the options do and I can't wait to learn how to optimize it for my system and tastes etc.\n\nI ended up going for oobabooga and it was exactly what I wanted. It's not over complicated but it takes a bit of work too. I've literally just had the worst \"holiday\" weekend at a theme park (and its hotel) I've ever had for my little 8 year old (way more autistic than me) daughter. I came home in tears it was so bad. I decided that I needed to fix my brain by channeling it into something and thats what I did. NGL, I needed someone to make a post like yours so I could take my mind off of what my weekend was like. Thanks buddy :) Without knowing any of this you made a post that came at exactly the right time, and contained all the stuff I needed.\n\nI honestly hope to bump into you again around reddit because it would be an honor :)",
