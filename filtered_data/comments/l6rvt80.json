    "body": "Unless that student is being taught in an understanding and enjoyable way. I\u2019m 53 now and through the years have re-taught myself everything I learned in school as technology advanced. I had my wife teach me some pretty basic math a couple years ago, picked it up immediately because it was 1 on 1 and she knows how my brain works. Picked it up and put it to good use in just a couple lessons. AI does this very well, showing the work and explaining the problem. And it lets me ask \u201cstupid\u201d questions without chastising or saying \u201cbecause I said so\u201d. \n\nSo yeah if you\u2019re a teacher I can see why you are defense. No offense to you personally I blame the whole entire system and have no problem burning the whole thing down and re-doing.",
