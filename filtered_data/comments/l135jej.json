    "body": "Ok thanks tbh I\u2019m doing an access to higher education course (equivalent of a levels) I\u2019m technically in my gap year & my year 5 teacher ages ago before AI was a proper thing told us for homework to just copy and paste things and change it up a bit. Probably really unprofessional but basically everyone in that class has had quite a lot of experience of making things original. I pretty much used AI to write the essays as an outline then changed it up as much as I could which hopefully is enough if not I should have everything covered to get a second shot where I won\u2019t use AI at all",
