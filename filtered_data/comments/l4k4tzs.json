    "body": "Bro I know I kinda am sawing away at my own chair. but firstly I am trying to learn as much as possible right now about AI and education because this is the fututre, if we use it in class right now or not. When they start cutting jobs I hope to be one they want to keep because of my expertise.\n\nsecond is a serious ethical question. If I am convinced that these tools can enhance learning in a way traditional teaching methods simply cannot, how can I not teach my kids how to use them? What kind of teacher would I be to not show my Ukrainian students how they can use these tools to enhance their learning experience and actually understand what we are doing in class? Good thing is in Germany almost all of us have tenure and the educational field is pretty conservative. Parents will always want someone there with their kids. When they start firing tenured teachers (litearlly almost impossible in Germany unless you break the law or really severlely neglect your duties to the state) we will have way different problems.",
