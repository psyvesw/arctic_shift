    "body": "As somebody who works in big tech at a company everyone knows -- nobody within 'tech' at the non c-suite level is happy with the big picture of AI and it doesn't take a masters degree or programming background to see it... I always grew up around the concept of hard-work or outworking others to get ahead. I think my greatest depression that I've felt is lately within the last year is a sense that my work doesn't matter anymore. I get my greatest happiness from coaching soccer and managing kids' quarrels like throwing turf grounds at each other. I value human-to-human interaction so much because I don't know when it's going to end. I never used to think that way, but I increasingly feel like we just don't have much time anymore, but hopefully we do and I'm wrong about how I feel about the trajectory of humanity",
