    "body": "College teacher here. I would hope you don't have to dumb down your papers, but smart them up...we realize that this is a big problem!\n\nTwo things I have noticed:\n\n1. If you want to avoid having students become dependent on AI, you have to get ultra focused. You can't just assign general papers on \"women characters in Shakespeare\" or \"the causes of the Civil War\" or \"improving marketing campaigns for younger audiences.\" You are just asking for AI unoriginallity, blather, meandering, and hallucinations. Rather, I create specialized videos and text content that addresses our issues and topics and have students respond PRECISELY AND EXACTLY to this non-publicly available content...so it's very easy to tell when they've resorted to AI. \n\n2. As a teacher, you can't just go with the scores of an AI or plagiarism detection program because they really are very unsophisticated in a lot of ways. For example, a student might get a 67% score on plagiarism software. Sounds bad but then when I look at the highlighted text it's because they have a lot of quotes. And they've done the quotes properly with citations. So maybe in terms of writing they should be less quote heavy but they are certainly not \"plagiarizing.\"",
