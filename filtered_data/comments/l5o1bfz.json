I don't think AI itself will solve that issue unless the system integrates AI in a way that would allow kids to have individualist coaching while still somehow testing them in a way that could normalize the performance and make it somehow comparable.   \n(Unless you get rid of grades and performance entirely, which would be the actual way to go)",
