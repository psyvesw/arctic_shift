    "body": "There are thousands of fantastic creatives who haven\u2019t necessarily got artistic skill, yet they could have exciting and profound creations given they could pay someone to realise their vision. The biggest problem with AI is that, at the moment, thousands of concept artists jobs are at stake because AI allows anyone to continually redraft their concepts, honing in on their ideal vision, with little to no extra cost and with decent results. \n\nThere is an argument for AI art being soulless, however if the art is created by the lead programmer in a game for example, we can see projects come to life with such refined vision, which, in my opinion produces the most amazing indie games. \n\nArtists need to start working alongside AI to help them draft ideas then refine them further with their own details which require more complex and emotional input, AI is actually going to result in more impactful art and design as people learn to use it for foundational work allowing them to craft the truly unique and human elements",
