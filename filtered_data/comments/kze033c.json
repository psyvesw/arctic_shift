    "body": "This is exactly why you shouldn't bother about it for now. Why you should is because today's GPT 3.5 is so dumb and delusional at times that you can just make your assignment look bad if you're using it incorrectly. I found my 100% self-written assignments scored better than AI-assisted ones, with some exceptions. It got to a point where it's really time-consuming to read through AI's text and edit it up in comparison to just doing it yourself. GPT-4 does a little better if you're looking for an assist, but it's pretty much the same chore for $20. All in all, if you're capable of scoring within your desired range, you're much better to do it on your own, plus no risk of fighting someone over AI because of extra 10% you wanted to grab.",
