    "body": "That it has agency, and uses it in an obviously intelligent way. GPT does not have agency, because it may only respond to user input. I won't regard any AI as AGI until it has convincing autonomous control of something approximating a body. It has to be able to \\*do something\\* in the real world, \\*on its own\\*. If it can do that, in real time, consistently, reliably and in the service of internal goals, then I think it passes all the other tests implicitly. It will obviously need memory, learning, planning, language, some kind of kinematic/motor control, etc. Of course, an AI that demonstrates all these things would also be fucking terrifying. So there is that.",
