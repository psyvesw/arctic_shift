    "body": "**Agreed, but also learn from what it spits out.**\n\nI started learning python with ChatGPT around March of last year.   \nI mostly just had it make tools I wanted/needed. \n\nSometimes it would give me code with an error it couldn't solve, so I had to dig into it myself and figure out *why* it wasn't working (and by extension, figure out what it was trying to do). \n\n**This is where I learned the most.** Having a mostly done project with a few errors was like a puzzle to me. I had all of the pieces, just a few were out of place. And the neat part was that I had *working examples of other functions along side of those errors*. Double learning.\n\nI now have a *decent* understanding of python and [a pretty okay github page with a few handy tools](https://github.com/remghoost). I still use AI (ChatGPT, Claude, and hopefully llama-3 soon) for the bulk of my code, but I can at least follow along with it and make suggestions now. And I can write code to fill in the gaps.",
