    "body": "I use it sometimes as a Google search alternative, but there are certain subjects chatgpt will not present to you because of OpenAI policy. I still use Google because of that, I used it for sports betting (pulling data and explaining certain bet types). I used it to explain why a particular stock in the market was up or down, I also used it to help craft messages for emails and social media.\n\nEven with those things I used it for, I struggle to find an everyday use for it. I view it more as a personal assistant. Most people who use it are in some kind of field that requires coding, creative writing, or in school, etc. \n\nI just want it to tell me what the traffic is like at 430pm without me prompting it. A reminder on my phone should trigger a prompt on the chatgpt app.\n\nIf more folks found an everyday use for it that brings some sort of value to their life, more people would use it.",
