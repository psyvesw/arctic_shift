    "body": "People get caught because they aren\u2019t going through what AI wrote. They are not removing words that they wouldn\u2019t personally use, or reading through for any content errors. They also are creating the file and then copy and paste AI and then immediately uploading the assignment. My professor checks the timestamp of assignments to check how long the assignment took to write before uploading. Theses are just a few examples but there\u2019s many more. \n\nAs a masters program student, I have found that my professor uses AI to grade my assignments so before submitting my assignment, I ask AI to grade my assignment and provide feedback. That way I can improve what I know she would want me to improve based on her method of grading.",
