    "body": "IMHO, no, they have no ability to reason or understand. They're glorified mad lib solvers. They just pick the next word or phrase based on a bunch of probabilistic weights that were generated by scanning a whole corpus of documents comprising the entirety of human history. There are nuggets of truth to be gleaned because there's an underlying assumption that humans have renewed to record the truth. That enables you to ask questions like \"is the earth round?\" and the most likely response is simply \"yes\" in spite of the fact that there are other responses to the question. However, the AI has never lived on this planet, has never seen it, and could never possibly know. \n\nOf course there's a case to be made that AI models do in fact think and reason in the same way as people because the neural networks that drive them are designed to work in the same way as neurons. I've been meaning to take the horrible, horrible leap to read more Immanuel Kant who created a large body of philosophy about what it means to think or reason or know, but I absolutely despise his writing style. If you want to think more profoundly about the topic, I'd recommend studying some philosophy to get a head start on various concepts and models",
