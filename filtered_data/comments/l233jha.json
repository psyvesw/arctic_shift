    "body": "GPT helps me understand concepts, from the ones I come across in my academic studies to how I structure my sentences when writing comments. I have yet to find that it makes me understand less. I think GPT is a tool that the end user defines the usage of. If your interest is to get something done quickly, then it's easy to see how knowledge might not be attained.\n\nHowever, if we use it to understand concepts while also studying them, then I assume it enhances our understanding of the subject matter we're using it for. I wouldn't have written this type of comment just a year ago, as it would be full of the word \"fucking\" and hyperbole, not to mention lacking in fancy words, but thanks to GPT my writing has gotten better than it used to be.",
