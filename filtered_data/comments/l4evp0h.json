    "body": "I use \"What matters is individuality and uniqueness of expression\" lol\n\n1. You're telling it \"should\" that means \"not necessarily\"\n\n2. \"Multi-dimensional\" information is probably not a real thing so you're not forcing it to be extra special, you're giving it room to interpret your instructions. \n\n3. \"You should reason and think before giving your argument\". Is that even possible for AI because if not it might try to simulate that approach or it might ignore this. \n\n4. \"And it should be such that I may not be able to refute what you say\" isn't always possible and if the instruction is impossible it's going to improvise. And again you say \"should\" implying it has a choice. \n\n5. The verbosity of your sentences isn't helping the AI implement the instructions you want clear, consice, minimalistic but direct approach. Like you're explaining it to a dumb human--not because it's dumb but because it needs to run in the background/subconscious.",
