    "body": "Chat gpt is a bot with a lot of knowledge. I agree it's really awesome and informative to have conversations with it. I use it for work, to learn about things and to bounce ideas off it. I'd rather be \"addicted\" to this app than any other because I honestly feel I can learn so much in a short time (much easier and less effort than searching on Google)\n\n\nI agree that it does seem intelligent. I have the paid version. I think many commenters don't have the paid version or don't understand. It's not perfect but it is a huge leap for AI for sure. It seems to keep getting better too.",
