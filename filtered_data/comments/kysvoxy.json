    "body": "It's only stupid if you go off one word. If you use multiple words that have that kind of usage statistic especially in things like student submissions, you get close to 99.9% chance it's AI written.\n\nSay \"delve\" is 9/10 chatgpt generated. That's still 10% that are legit which is way too high of a false positive rate. But if you have 5 of those kinds of words, you can be far more certain. \n\nOf course still the easiest way to tell is to look at the past writing of students and notice any profound jumps, but that's both cumbersome for already overburdened teachers and not always data every school makes available. A tool would likely help with that which would combine both methods. Use AI to fight AI and all.",
