    "body": "One thing I notice is that beginners are always super impressed with the output of an LLM, but it\u2019s actually very rudimentary and more often than not it\u2019s sloppy and unoptimized. But if you couldn\u2019t write code before, now you can generate it and sometimes it works, which is cool, but keep in mind, code is also a language just like the language you use to instruct the LLM. \n\nIf you\u2019re just using an LLM to avoid learning the language because it\u2019s too hard or whatever, you are likely going to struggle with a wide range of fundamental concepts both in and outside of computer science. All I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t unintentionally nerf yourself. \n\nI already have horror stories of people who tried to get by with ChatGPT. I\u2019ve interviewed 2 people for software jobs now who tried to have someone off screen lookup the answers in ChatGPT and they failed horribly anyway. It was painful and embarrassing, don\u2019t be that guy.",
