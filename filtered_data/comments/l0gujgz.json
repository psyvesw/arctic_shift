    "body": "You'd have to ask the self-hating white liberals that introduced the anti-white bias.  Who knows the strange things that go through diseased minds?  It is definitely NOT a coincidence though and is seemingly coordinated since they all do it, some to much more extreme levels.\n\nI deal in facts.  It is a fact that none of the big tech AI image generators to one degree or another allow pictures to be generated that would put black characters in a bad light, but they have no qualms about doing that to white characters.\n\nIf there were a videogame where all of the white characters were able to be killed with one shot every time, but somehow all bullets miraculously missed every single black character every single time you wouldn't think that was fishy?  Now how about that happening in EVERY videogame produced by a cabal of left-leaning video game producers?  That's where we're at.\n\nThanks for REEEEEing and proving my point with your denials though.",
