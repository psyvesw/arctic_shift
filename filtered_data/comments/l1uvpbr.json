    "body": "Of course, I use it non-stop, for everything from generating boilerplate code to pasting in pages upon pages of documentation and asking it questions so I don\u2019t need to read the whole thing (we have RAG at home lol).\n\nNow put your tinfoil hat on\u2026\n\nI think all these layoffs happening in tech is due to the increase in productivity across the board from engineers. They only use the over-hiring during low interest rates thing as an excuse. Those over hired people got let go a looong time ago. Now companies are continuing to fire people cause they can. They don\u2019t see a sharp drop in productivity with less people cause many among them are using AI to do several times the work that they did before!\n\nAnd such layoff numbers don\u2019t show up in the census reporting cause hiring managers and HR departments at tech companies are told to flood the market with job postings that they keep up perennially with no intent to actually fill those roles. Because that gives off a growth look and rake in the cash from shareholders. Even on tech discussion boards like Blind hiring managers openly admit to this kind of practice. Another reason for doing it is to keep employees in check, to show that they\u2019re always 1 step away from being replaced if they slow down.\n\nAnyway all this will soon be revealed when companies can no longer hide it. Why do you think inflation hasn\u2019t gone down even after all these interest rate hikes and the job market supposedly being great. Lol everyone is being had.",
