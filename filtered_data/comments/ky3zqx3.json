    "body": "That\u2019s kind of what the problem is. We don\u2019t have a proper definition for what it means to think. Or what sentience is. \n\nCertainly AI can learn in a very similar way to how humans learn. In terms of \u201cpredicting the next token\u201d as you call it, it also does that in a similar way to humans.\n\nThe argument for sentience is so messy because we simply don\u2019t know what sentience is. Humans are sentient\u2014we think and feel and have senses of selves. Most animals are sentient\u2014they also think and feel, and some certainly have senses of selves. Does an earthworm have a sense of self? Does a bug? I would argue bugs are sentient to a degree, because they can see and feel, and I assume think (in a very different way to humans.) Do they feel emotions or have a sense of self? It\u2019s up for debate. We know bees play. What about plants or fungi? They\u2019re alive. They move. They transmit messages to eachother. But they\u2019re not sentient by the modern definition. \n\nSo, right now, what level is AI on? It can think\u2014that already puts it ahead of plants and fungi. Figure 01, the robot that runs on chatGPT can move, see, and feel (as in the tactile sense) things. It can identify things that it sees. That\u2019s pretty much on the same level as bugs or earthworms. Depending on your definition of sentience, it could be as sentient as a low level animal. It has higher communication skills but no feelings or sense of self.",
