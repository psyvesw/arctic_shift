    "body": "Reverse engineering blobs of text to see if it's AI generated using AI isn't feasible because of the randomness given to each token. You would essentially be decrypting it in a convoluted kind of way and this could only be done using quantum computers. By then, alternative methods would be put into place to bypass this, so it's not likely to ever be possible especially since a lot of people are using it as a collaborative tool, rather than a complete replacement. This will eventually change and the attitude of people will be all about AI, it just takes an extra generation. Kids born today will grow up in a completely different world and to them, they will be indoctrinated to believe it is normal, acceptable and the cool thing. Only \"boomers\" would disagree.\n\nHappens with every generation with clever marketing and gullible people. The best that we can do is just learn to adapt and survive in this paradigm shift. I can certainly imagine small societies (towns) living like we do today, similarly to the Amish, where robots don't exist. Doubtful it would be peaceful, Amish and other similar communities are looked down by the gov and under a microscope.",
