    "body": "I had Chat GPT 3.5(I'm poor) write lyrics.  Yours are better.  Here's the chatGPT lyrics:\n\n(Verse 1)\nWell, I woke up this mornin', feeling kinda blue,\nWent to the bathroom, but my troubles just grew.\nBeen sittin' here for hours, feelin' like a statue,\nOh, lordy, lordy, what's a poor soul to do?\n\n(Chorus)\nI got the constipation blues, stuck in a bind,\nCan't seem to get movin', feelin' confined.\nBeen drinkin' prune juice, eatin' fiber by the ton,\nBut my gut's all backed up, and it ain't no fun.\n\n(Verse 2)\nTried pushin' and straining, like I'm liftin' weights,\nBut my bowels ain't budgin', stuck behind iron gates.\nBeen prayin' to the toilet gods, beggin' for relief,\nBut it seems like my colon's on a permanent leaf.\n\n(Chorus)\nI got the constipation blues, stuck in a bind,\nCan't seem to get movin', feelin' confined.\nBeen poppin' laxatives, like they're candy in a jar,\nBut my stomach's still silent, like a broken guitar.\n\n(Bridge)\nOh, doctor, doctor, won't you lend me a hand?\nI'm feelin' so bloated, like I'm filled with quicksand.\nI'll try anything, just to get things flowin' right,\nCause this constipation's got me losin' sleep at night.\n\n(Verse 3)\nWell, I finally felt a rumble, like a distant thunderstorm,\nRushed back to the bathroom, like a bull in a dorm.\nAnd with a mighty roar, like a freight train on the track,\nI finally found relief, ain't no turnin' back.\n\n(Chorus)\nI had the constipation blues, but now I'm free,\nFeels like I just won the lottery.\nSo here's a lesson learned, for all you folks out there,\nKeep your pipes clear, and you'll have no despair.",
