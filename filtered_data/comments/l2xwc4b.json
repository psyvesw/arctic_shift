    "body": "I don\u2019t think \u201cbeing an adult\u201d means ignoring toxic behaviour from a friend. The OP mentioned many times that this \u201cfriend\u201d of theirs has been using ChatGPT for projects that they were grouped together with, even for the largest project of the course. OP mentioned it to them nicely many times before, and asked them to avoid using ChatGPT, and if they did, to source it. The \u201cfriend\u201d did not listen and got even more defensive, which I think is toxic behaviour actually. Writing an apology letter USING AI for not doing anything during the project, plus using ai (which the whole argument was about) and not treating the OP with respect as they treated them is shameless.",
