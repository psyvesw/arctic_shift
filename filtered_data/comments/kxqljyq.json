    "body": "Geezus it gets better. It appears even if you set the default model on Perplexity to Claude 3 Opus, if you ask it something of a very recent nature, it's smart enough to use another source.  I had heard about people using Perplexity but now I feel stupid I didn't kick the tires a lot earlier.\n\nPrompt: what teams are in the 2024 men's final four basketball  \nClaude 3 Opus direct response:\n\nI apologize, but as of March 2023, the 2024 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament has not yet taken place. The Final Four teams for the 2024 tournament will not be determined until the tournament is played in March and April of 2024.\n\nPerplexity Pro Response:\n\nBased on the information provided in the search results, the teams in the 2024 men's NCAA Final Four are:\n\n1. (1) Connecticut Huskies\n2. (4) Alabama Crimson Tide\n3. (1) Purdue Boilermakers\n4. (11) North Carolina State Wolfpack\n\nThe Final Four matchups are:\n\n* (1) Connecticut vs. (4) Alabama, scheduled for 8:49 p.m. ET on Saturday, April 6[2](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2024/03/31/mens-final-four-dates-times-location-bracket-teams/73161908007/)[5](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2024-03-31/2024-march-madness-mens-ncaa-tournament-schedule-dates)[8](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10115045-mens-final-four-2024-full-breakdown-predictions-and-stars-to-watch)\n* (1) Purdue vs. (11) North Carolina State, scheduled for 6:09 p.m. ET on Saturday, April 6[2](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2024/03/31/mens-final-four-dates-times-location-bracket-teams/73161908007/)[5](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2024-03-31/2024-march-madness-mens-ncaa-tournament-schedule-dates)[8](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10115045-mens-final-four-2024-full-breakdown-predictions-and-stars-to-watch)\n\nThe games will be played at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona[2](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2024/03/31/mens-final-four-dates-times-location-bracket-teams/73161908007/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament)[5](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2024-03-31/2024-march-madness-mens-ncaa-tournament-schedule-dates).\u00a0The championship game is scheduled for Monday, April 8 at the same venue[2](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2024/03/31/mens-final-four-dates-times-location-bracket-teams/73161908007/)[5](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2024-03-31/2024-march-madness-mens-ncaa-tournament-schedule-dates).Notably, UConn and NC State both have their men's and women's teams in the Final Four this year, which is the first time two schools have accomplished this feat in the same season[6](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2024/03/31/basketball-schools-men-women-teams-final-four/73163300007/).\n\nGemini (free) could answer it but didn't give the location or game details. The CoPilot response was very similar so it looks like Perplexity recognized I was asking for info beyond Claude's cutoff date so it failed over to GPT-4 for the information which I believe gets it's \"real time\" data from Bing Search Engine DB due to the partnership with Microsoft.",
