    "body": "As a manager in a claims processing center, one of my teams did the call center operator training.  Six weeks of in class lecture and hands on the system, to prepare for taking calls from clients about their plan and account.\n\nBoth the sales and implementation teams were so fucking bad at their jobs we were sometimes ordered to strip down training from six weeks to three... days.\n\nSo yeah, I think most call centers would be improved by the move to AI sometime in the next couple to five years.  Although the fucktard C-suite hemorrhoids at my old company would probably cheap out on training those too.",
