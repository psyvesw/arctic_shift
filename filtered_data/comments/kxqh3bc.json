    "body": "Excuse my French, but Holy Sh\\*t.  I just subscribed to the free 7-day trial for Perplexity Pro. Set the default model to Claude 3 Opus and gave it some research questions I used before and the response has citation links to the studies!  The response is significantly different than using Claude 3 Opus direct but not really in a bad way, there's a lot of overlap. But at least now I can fact check MUCH quicker. Having the source study citation links is pretty much worth finally paying for a subscription to one of these as opposed to just doing pay as you go through the Claude or GPT developer backdoor API route.  \n\nI'll have to use it more to see if it's better than Copilot Free (which I think is using GPT4-Turbo more and more now) to justify the subscription.\n\nI read your review and it prompted me to have a more urgent sense of trying to leverage this technology to incorporate my own local data.  I have a lot of research notes in Word docs and tons of clipped web pages stored in Evernote.  It's funny, I just pressed the CoPilot button on the bottom right of Windows Task Bar and asked it if it can incorporate the content of my documents on my local machine and it said (of course) it can't as it's just a shortcut to the web copilot.  \n\nI would guess Evernote is building an AI chatbot. As far as I can tell it's only using AI for editing notes.\n\nI really need want a chatbot that will expand its data set to include all the data in my spreadsheets and documents on my PC and in Evernote. So if my note has a link to a study it will go on the internet and include the study data into how it formulates a response.",
