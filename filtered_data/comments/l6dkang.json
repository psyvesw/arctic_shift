    "body": "I work as an IT security specialist and I do some research about quantum cryptography , meanwhile I\u2019m 48 and as I can remember all my life I was very interested in technology\u2026.only from experience and what I saw in my life until now is that people at the beginning tend not to use technology and something new until it gets inevitable. Back in the days when the WWW was making it first steps out of CERN , very few people were excited back then, until they got more in touch with it. Myself since the introduction of chatGPT in 2022 I use it every day and I also build ~15 GPT\u2018s in the OpenAI store, I also use Claude, Perplexity, Copilot. The potential is huge and older generations are not so much interested in it, but many young folks are using it. This is great, because focus should be pointed more to young people and make them more agile using LLM\u00b4s, I don\u2019t say \u201eAI\u201c because we are very far away to achieve absolute AGI, this is a holy grail in technology that we might never achieve. But it\u2019s ok to baptize it \u201eAI\u201c , it\u2019s a catchy name and many people associate it with future like situations \u201eTerminator\u201c and other distopian stuff\ud83d\ude06.  I love working with GPT\u00b4s, it is time saving and the only drawback is to double check some facts that might not be correct. It is in the first steps and errors can occur, that is ok, with time more and more advanced mechanisms will be implemented\u2026 so yes, GPTs are here to stay and people should consider to use them and mostly to use them in schools( the school system in general IMHO must be changed). These are my simple thoughts on this question.",
