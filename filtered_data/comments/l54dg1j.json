    "body": "I've reported a student using chat-GPT in the report of a project. It was fairly obvious. \n\nThe structure of the paragraphs. Some of the words used were strange and replicable. Some sentences were also quite broad. They then admitted its use.\n\nI'm not an instructor; if I was I probably wouldn't care, you're just never going to learn how to write a good paper that way anyways. I'm not sure what the instructor did as a penalty (if they gave them a 2nd chance or reported it to the department). But the best part of this was the paper wasn't of good quality. Even if I somehow didn't notice they'd of received a C at best.\n\nI should probably mention this isn't an essay, it's more intended to be like a paper that could possibly lead to a publication, which is why it's really bad for this use case. Chat-GPT might be better for broader essay writing.",
