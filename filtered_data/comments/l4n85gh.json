Yet to predict you need to understand the underlying process that produced the data. You need to understand more and more about the world that produced the data.\n\nAs our generative models become extraordinarily good, they will have, I claim, a shocking degree of understanding of the world and many of its subtleties. It is the world as seen through the lens of text. It tries to learn more and more about the world through a projection of the world on the space of text as expressed by human beings on the internet. But still, this text already expresses the world. And I'll give you an example, a recent example, which I think is really telling and fascinating. we've all heard of Sydney being its alter-ego. And I've seen this really interesting interaction with Sydney where Sydney became combative and aggressive when the user told it that it thinks that Google is a better search engine than Bing.\n\nWhat is a good way to think about this phenomenon? What does it mean? You can say, it's just predicting what people would do and people would do this, which is true. But maybe we are now reaching a point where the language of psychology is starting to be appropriated to understand the behavior of these neural networks.\u201d Ilya Sutskever \n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2023/03/15/gpt-4-creator-ilya-sutskever-on-ai-hallucinations-and-ai-democracy/",
