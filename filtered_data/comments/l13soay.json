    "body": "  \nI've created an AI social service on Discord called Lightup, and I'd love for everyone to get to know and experience it. Lightup offers two main features:\n\n1. **Content-Based Matching**: Utilizing NLP, computer vision algorithms, and semantic understanding, we match users based on shared interests and thoughts. For example, if you're a fan of Shakespeare and share this interest, you can connect with others who have also expressed similar interests. This fosters genuine resonance among users.\n2. **Friendship Search Engine**: Lightup acts like a search engine for social connections. Just tell it the type of person you want to interact with, and it will find them for you, whether it's a work partner, a fellow hobbyist, a travel companion, a study buddy, a movie-going friend, or even a romantic partner. This AI understands you and serves as your personal social coordinator.\n\nThis AI is designed to help you connect deeply with others, eliminating the need to tirelessly swipe left or right. It efficiently filters out unsuitable matches, making it easier to find like-minded individuals. You can find Lightup by searching for it on Discord. I look forward to your support and feedback.",
