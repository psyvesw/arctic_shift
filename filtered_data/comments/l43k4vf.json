    "body": "Yeah, the speed is much much higher. It's much harder to get it to think things through now though. It loves to generate swathes of text. But then it uses placeholders, I ask it to slow down and not use placeholders, and it just generates the same again. Or it mixes up names for things. Or uses bash style variables in Ansible scripts. Or guesses wildly even when told to look something up.\n\nOf course it is an awesome tool. I use it all the time. Alongside Devin (where I got early access and it's pretty amazing) and the JetBrains AI (which is worse than ChatGPT4, but well-integrated in the IDE - who knows, maybe they'll switch to 4o as well as the underlying engine, shouldn't be a huge change depending on how they've set up the integration).\n\nSo, awesome tool. But I have to get used to prompting 4o first. Like, \"answer in 50 words or less\" is a good thing to add. Or \"answer the actual question and don't generate redundant bs.\" Or also \"look things up online if you don't know\", even though that often still makes it guess randomly and pretend it looked it up, so \"look things up and provide references,\" even if the links then aren't always clickable, makes it go online more often.",
