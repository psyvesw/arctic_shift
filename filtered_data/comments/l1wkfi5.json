    "body": "Don\u2019t give AI a task like \u201cfind all the words that start with x\u201d. Give AI a task like \u201cwrite a Google apps script that will find all the words that start with x,\u201d or \u201cwrite a Python code that does xyz.\u201d\n\nAs of now, AI can do that kind of thing. It\u2019s great at making tools, it\u2019s not the best at _being those tools_.\n\nI\u2019m a teacher. There are administrative tasks I find tedious and repetitive. I have a ChatGPT subscription, but don\u2019t pay for the API. So I ask it how to do Python programming. How can I open a web browser with Python, push a button, find a button or text, move the mouse, take a screen shot, save a file, read from a file, convert a file to PDF, all sorts of crap. THAT is when things get fun. AI doesn\u2019t have to replace you: AI can make you better. Honestly, if I was in a regular 9-5 and my job didn\u2019t ride on the success of children, AI would allow me to take a 4 day work week with 5 day productivity. But the world today will dangle the carrot, and make us work a 5 day workweek for 6 day productivity.\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s how I use AI in my job, and I have a dozen or so spreadsheets that are fairly complicated, and at least 1 Python program that can save me days of work per quarter. Being able to run a program and fall asleep knowing that it will email me and turn off the computer when it\u2019s done is the craziest thing ever.",
