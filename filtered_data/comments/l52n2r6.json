    "body": "Everybody is aware of the value of the interaction data.  \n\nA second benefit is that it helps solidify their market position.  When non geeks hear about AI they associate it with ChatGPT.  Geeks might add Llama to that list. The dozens of others, including Claude and Gemini, are unknown outside tech circles.  \n\nPeople are self-learning this stuff.  If Claude was free while ChatGPT charged then people would learn Claude and mindshare would shift.  \n\nAs recently as a couple weeks ago, most people I talked to didn't know ChatGPT could handle arithmetic or images because the free version didn't.  Their friends showing them Gemini was a risk....\n\nIt's like the old search engine wars.  We Google for things, we don't Bing for them, or Yahoo! them.  Normal people don't have the mental space for more than one association, and holding the podium will pay dividends.",
