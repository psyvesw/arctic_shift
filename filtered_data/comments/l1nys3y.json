    "body": "I\u2019m a professor. I assigned an in-class writing assignment using APA fully, in-text citations and references page. I helped the entire time my students wrote to assure they were doing everything properly. End result - Turnitin plus an AI detector were worthless. Bottom line - anything ever written that\u2019s online comes up as plagiarism even when quoted and cited. It happened with 88/90 papers. I expect to see at least 30% come up as plagiarism in the future, and honestly I\u2019ll use a base writing assignment as an assessment tool to compare a student\u2019s ability. I hope this makes sense, I have just graded 120 research papers and I\u2019m exhausted. Students are going to cheat and I hate it; I remind them that none of us wants a nurse, teacher, doctor, pilot, engineer or CPA that cheated their way through university. It\u2019s just too new to be  the final word on a student\u2019s work. Talk to your professor face to face. Good luck.",
