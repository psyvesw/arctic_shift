    "body": ">I get the strong feeling most people espousing these opinions that it's \"just a fad like NFTs\" generally aren't in, or don't really talk to students in school or those in the corporate tech/law world or in teaching/medical/journalism.\n\nAgreed. I've also observed that there's a weird generational factor, one that's pretty counterintuitive. In my observations, GenX has been the quickest to embrace this new technology.  I work at a software company, but my wife is a housewife and she's even more excited than I am about the changes AI will create in the world. Our Boomer parents, our Millennial children, and our grandchildren are all disinterested. I think it's because GenX has twice now watched the world change before our eyes, whereas younger generations have no memory of a pre-computer, pre-internet world and have no practical experience with paradigm-changing technological development. Even the Millennial developers at my company have been slow to embrace AI assistance, despite their GenX manager's pressure to utilize AI to improve their productivity like he has. \n\nCertainly, there are exceptions in all generations, I very much agree that circumstances that you outlined like being a student can disrupt general generational trends, and I'm certainly not saying GenX is better than anyone else. I agree with everything you are saying about how life experiences change how receptive people are to embracing the changes AI is bringing. It's just that through no effort on our part, GenX has had life experiences like those you describe. It doesn't make GenX better, it just makes GenX lucky.",
