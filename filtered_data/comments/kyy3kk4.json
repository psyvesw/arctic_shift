    "body": "You're specific about wanting GPT4. u/Blockchainauditor is asking what GPT4 can do that Copilot can't do. As in, why do you want GPT4?\n\nPeople will be very reluctant to give you their login information. You could steal the account, and I'm pretty sure giving away the login information is against the EULA. It's always prudent to be careful when someone suggests a course of action where they gain but you run the risk.\n\nA way that might help, DM whatever prompts you want, and they can DM you the results. No one needs to exchange passwords. If you're feeling really trusting, Zoom chat and have the GPT user share their screen as you tell them what you want.",
