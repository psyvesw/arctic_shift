    "body": "Yep, regarding the cost, I think I didn\u2019t express myself properly. I consider \u201ccomputation\u201d, in the simile, every aspect you mentioned, both in the filogenetic and ontogenetic sense, plus the behaviour itself. I would hold on to the economic cost, though, because the notion or survival is not short sighted. It includes the cost of transcendence of the individual - its permanence in time via the species. The cost of reproducing efficiently (so romantic, am I not?) us taken into account. Finally, the living has costs that are nut even taken into consideration by the very design of AI - the subconscious, sleeping, dreaming - which are indeed costly but fundamental. Which segues into:\n\n> With the possible exception of arts\n\nHere we are. Most recent signal generation forces us to rethink what is exclusively and inherently human. The study book for the General Linguistics course for the cohort 2015-2016 still had the first chapter holding that the natural language as a specificity of the human, making it unique among the other known forms of communication. It is very coincidentally interesting, imho, that the art genre which is exquisitely performed by the various generative machines is Surrealism (if we do not take hallucinations as bugs but as features, we could say that we have invented the most extraordinary surrealistic machines), and that one of the most common visual hallucinations by diffusion models was related to the incapacity of correctly rendering hands, digits, language glyphs, and so on, the same phenomena that happen in dreams. \n\n> not about the current stage of AI\n\nI believe we agree that being the cutting edge technology that AI is, we must also acknowledge that we wouldn\u2019t be discussing it in the same way today, if we didn\u2019t have the push in the fourth quarter of 2022.",
