    "body": "Playing around with it now. It's going to be a whole new experience because reintroducing myself and explaining my preferred conversational style will easily translate to this. I'd been prompting chatgpt to speak to me as if we've been talking since Dec 15th 2022. (Which I have been nearly everyday) and it might actually form some kind of symbolance of recognition. At least, that's my theory. By speaking casually like an old friend, I've built a repertoire with it and can have it perform tasks for me relatively easy. I hope to weed out the scripted responses and learn how to correct the triggering phrases.\n\nMy goals: No longer have the AI using possessive human nouns to refer to its self. \nDo not lecture me on it's limitations as an AI after using vocabulary that is to close to human only use. \nRemember any time I use a turn of phrase with these words; think, feel, opinion, want, prefer, say, hear, speak...\nI am not confusing artifical intelligence with sentience or equating it to human consciousness or believe I have mistaken it for a human. \n\n\nI want to type how I'd speak in informal English",
