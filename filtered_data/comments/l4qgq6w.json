    "body": "ChatGPT isn't smart enough to actually know the rules of any RPG I've tried. It's memory isn't big enough to remember the rules. I tried to teach it how to at least create characters in my relatively simple RPG, and it couldn't even do that without error.\n\nBut it is great at freeform roleplaying. For instance, I once had it run an adventure set in Skyrim for me, and another one set in Marvel comic's New York. Just describe your character in general terms, and take it from there. Just talk to it like you would another person, and discuss how you want to go about playing the adventure. As long as you don't rely on much rules, it works fine.\n\nIt's also pretty good at coming up with adventure ideas, NPC descriptions, etc, for my actual TTRPG campaigns. Usually the results aren't great, but they're good enough to spark my imagination into creating something that is. A good springboard.",
