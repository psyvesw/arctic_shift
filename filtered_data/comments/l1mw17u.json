    "body": "No. Why would they? ChatGPT is a tool like a pencil , a typewriter , a car, a compass, binoculars, PA system, a chair, name any tool...that's what ChatGPT is equivalent to.\n\nIs your teacher publishing academic papers and claiming sole authorship? No? Then there's no issue.\n\n>\u00a0It just feels wrong that this teacher has \u201crules for thee but not for me\u201d in her class and I wonder if anything should be done.\n\nA) your feelings are out of touch, out of place, and irrelevant. \n\nB) your job as a student is to learn and provide work that proves that you have learned. Cheating with ChatGPT has been studied and shown that kids don't learn and their attention span dimisihes. You claiming that you did learn by cheating is dishonorable, if you dishonor yourself through cheating, you disrespect the entire education process.\n\nC) your teacher's job is to *provide access to knowledge*, not to reinvent the wheel by rewriting every lesson off the top of her head\n\nD) get over it, finish your education and then you can use ChatGPT all you want after you graduate",
