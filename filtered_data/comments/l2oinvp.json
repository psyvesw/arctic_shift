    "body": "Look up an exponential growth curve and you\u2019ll see a visual representation of what Bostrom and others are pointing out. \n\nFirstly, we\u2019re far from AGI until we\u2019re not. That\u2019s the point. No one can say when that will happen and it breakout could happen in a day. Exponential growth is only one of the possibilities but it is 100% possible we could wake up tomorrow and find AGI where we weren\u2019t aware of it the day before. \n\nThe math here is not easy to convey in text on reddit but in short, if you can create an AI that can learn and improve on its own, it can learn nonstop much more rapidly than we can. Think of how robotics teaches walking now with thousands and thousands of simulations or how AlphaGo teaches Go with hundreds of thousands of games. Add in to that GAN technology as well. \n\nThis comment is long enough but in short: if breakout happens it could be in a timeframe we are wholly unprepared for and the intelligence in that scenario would outpace us incredibly quickly, long before we could react as a species.",
