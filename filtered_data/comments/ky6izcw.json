This isn't the first time someone said \"This technology will save the world\". In reality, there are winners and losers whenever a new technology comes around. I don't think that AI will destroy the world, but I don't think that we're going to get a utopia out of it either. It'll probably be another episode in the humanity long series of \"The rich get richer\".",
