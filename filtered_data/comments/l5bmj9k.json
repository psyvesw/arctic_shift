    "body": "I actually decided to ask the models why it was such a hard task for LLMs. Here's what Gemini answered:\n\n\"LLMs (Large Language Models) face a few challenges when dealing with accurate word counts:\n\n1. **Tokenization:** LLMs don't process words directly. They break text into smaller units called tokens. These can be words, parts of words, or even punctuation marks. This makes it difficult to establish a direct correspondence between tokens and the word count we're familiar with.\n2. **Language Variability:** Word definitions and counting rules can vary between languages and contexts. Some languages have compound words, contractions, and different punctuation rules, which can make it hard for an LLM to consistently apply a single word counting method.\n3. **Training Data Limitations:** LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data, but this data may not explicitly teach them how to count words accurately in every possible scenario. They learn patterns and associations, but not necessarily the precise rules for counting words.\n4. **Contextual Understanding:** While LLMs can understand the meaning of words and sentences to a certain extent, they might not always grasp the nuances of how word count limits are applied in specific contexts. For instance, are titles or footnotes included in the count? This lack of contextual understanding can lead to errors in word count estimation.\n5. **Model Complexity:** LLMs are incredibly complex, with billions of parameters. This complexity can make it challenging to pinpoint exactly how they are making decisions about word counts. It's a bit of a \"black box,\" where the model's internal workings are not always transparent.\n\nDespite these challenges, LLMs are getting better at word counting tasks. Developers are refining training methods and incorporating techniques to make LLMs more aware of token-word relationships and the nuances of word counting rules.\"\n\nI then, asked it to provide me with a prompt that would extract an optimal response in a task that involved a word count limit. And that's what it suggested:\n\n\"Please write a \\[text type\\] about \\[topic\\]. Your response should be approximately \\[target word count\\] words. Aim for a concise and focused style, avoiding unnecessary elaboration. If possible, provide a final word count at the end of your text.\"\n\nI tried it with GPT-4o and it worked the very first time!",
