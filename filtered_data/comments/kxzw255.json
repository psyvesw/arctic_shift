    "body": "I'm not American, we have more trust in our government's social policies & high taxes. If AI were to make most people redundant, it would be taxed well or restricted (ideally nationalized). People won't allow it in the market if it only brings destruction. My society does abandon some people in need, that will continue, but most people will be taken along.\n\nThere are many AI companies, at this stage it's very competitive & difficult to control. The best way to profit from AI is for AI companies to distribute it to as many people as possible. As things kick off, poor people will work alongside AI, while the upper-class buy worker bots. We'll see when/if AI goes independent, or gets bought up by Alphapplebetmazon, or something else.",
