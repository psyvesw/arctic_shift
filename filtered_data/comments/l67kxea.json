    "body": "Fellow middle-aged developer. I think maybe I already made peace with knowing fewer things.  I can\u2019t read 35 millions of Linux kernel code (I tried). Couldn\u2019t understand Postgres source well enough to contribute either. I have friends that played with embedded tech in the days of soldering irons and UV PROM chips. I could hack that either lol. Device drivers, windows services, ugh. Front end I am competent but not my fave there either. Those were all bitter pills to swallow for me over the past 30 years. \n\nWhat\u2019s funny for me though is I learn through conversation and get embarrassed asking dumb questions, so while I know I can\u2019t comprehend AI well enough to write the underlying code, I _can_ use ChatGPT to help me understand it. And I know enough about all sides of tech to ask the right questions where ChatGPT can fill in the answers. The key of course is that it only helps when I can independently verify what it says or understand the explanation. \n\nSo I say all that to say, you do need to process the feeling of being left out on the details, but I\u2019m confident that ultimately you can still find the tool can help you do things you couldn\u2019t otherwise. You can\u2019t force your own crowbar, but can sure as heck use a crowbar to make your job easier.",
