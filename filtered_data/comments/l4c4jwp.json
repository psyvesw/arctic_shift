    "body": "AI is going to break every single aspect of society, the same way that the Train and the Telegram broke every aspect of society. Everything is going to change. It's going to be like the invention of the wheel all over again. Society will have to be rebuilt around AI. The way we travel. The way we communicate. The way we reproduce. The way we learn. The way we consume. The way we create. The way we build. The way we heal. Every single aspect is going to change. Einstein once said something along the lines of, \"Never memorize something you can look up in a book.\" What would he say if he had access to something as powerful as the AI that will very soon be at the fingertips of everyone?",
