    "body": ">A similar example is structural analysis. Can an AI do structural analysis? Well, who knows other than structural engineers unless you\u2019re playing with fire. They are the ones who will be left to create those sorts of tools that AI can leverage for them, but at the end of the day, engineers still better be doing everything manually and analytically at some point or risk being blamed for a big mistake. \n\nExcept that exactly what structural analysis programs simulate. It's just up to the engineer if a result is acceptable. That's simply an if/then statement type calculation. \n\nThe issue is not that AI can't use the nuance of experience, in fact it's shown that AI can be better than people in nuanced situations because it lacks confirmation and historical biases that lead to false decisions. Look up research on how AI outperforms doctors for cancer diagnosis. \n\nThe issue is no AI has been trained and tuned to do the process properly. We also, to your point, hate the idea of a machine being the final decision point. We prefer people, despite the flaws in how cognition and our brains work.",
