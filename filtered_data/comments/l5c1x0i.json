    "body": "That is a copyright issue. ScarJo's is a likeness issue.  \nBut I agree that it is not over.\n\nHaving a paper trail about how things unfolded certainly helps OpenAI's argument, but does not irrefutably prove anything. It only means the authors of those documents may not have known anything, or are ready to perjure themselves. Them being essentially a text-generation company makes paper-trails also a bit suspect :).\n\nPreviously  in another case OpenAI requested the court not to let the plaintiff book publishers discover the identity of people involved with creation and deletion of book datasets. \n\nVery convenient that the purported artist's agent is willing to say things anonymously. I would be more impressed if they repeated all those things under oath, along with everyone else involved.\n\nThe story just does not make sense with C-level decision-makers contacting ScarJo directly and repeatedly with this particular intent. And then OpenAI just shrugging that well, look, it just happened to work out for us with this artist that well. Here are the documents detailing how we did not do exactly what our CEO tried semi-publicly.",
