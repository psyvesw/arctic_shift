    "body": "I wrote my essay and asked ChatGPT to polish it. I copied and pasted the new results and did a lot of editing. My teacher said Turnitin flagged it because it showed the large section was copied and pasted from an AI source. How does Turnitin see that? If the teacher had looked at the revision history, she would've noticed that the revised essay is pretty much like the original, except with fewer typos and bad grammar.  I guess it is better to just add the edits by typing, but it feels like a time waste since I was the source of all the original content. Teachers's are going to have to figure out how to incorporate AI because it is not going away and it is a great tool to help students self-teach and self-correct.",
