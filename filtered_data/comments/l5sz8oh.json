    "body": "I totally agree. Recently, I was trying to set up an OpenVPN server on my VPS with the help of ChatGPT. The initial task was simply \"help me set up OpenVPN running in a Docker container,\" and it handled that just fine. But then I asked it to implement periodically changing passwords via Google Authenticator, and it became a mess! I struggled so much trying to get GPT-4 and GPT-4o to do what I wanted. I even tried using Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude Opus. After several hours of unsuccessful attempts, I closed my laptop and decided to learn wtf \\`iptables\\` is and how routing works because I realized that all these AIs were failing, and I didn't even understand where.",
