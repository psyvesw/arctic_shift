    "body": "So - this is particularly interesting considering the recent release from openAI, but I'll start from the beginning.\n\nBasically, the models trained for images are only trained on images. For it to learn text, people are captioning the text in the models, like signs, and etc, and it's learning those. There's a text encoder that's paired to help prompt the image model with more exact detail specifically for text. \n\nIt could do it with coding, but that's a really, really abstract thought - when does it use code for text? That only works in a few niche types like cards - it wouldn't work for a billboard, or the sign above a store, or even like a tattoo.\n\nIt just comes down to - the image models used to generate just don't have any real strong concepts of text (it takes a lot of training to properly understand, and then there's fonts and variability all over).\n\nThe new release is interesting from openAI - while it does not do image creation itself, it does understand images sent to it, because it was trained as a single model to understand text, audio, and images. That's novel in that it has an understanding of both text and images together, not separate models doing each. \n\nThat's the future of it, though we're not quite where we want yet!",
