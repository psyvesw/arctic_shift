    "body": "They are not reliable at all.  \nNot hard to understand it if you think about it, it's trained to detect AI content, AI is trained on human proper content... so, if you content is so good and clean, it will just conclude that you are an AI. Also, most \"detectors\" do not say \"its 60% AI\" they often say \"Its possibly 60% AI\", there is no way to be sure, it's impossible, and as time goes on it's harder to detect... anyways, these tools aren't reliable, so you understand I literally just asked an AI to make me an article, asked a detector about it, and told me its 40% AI...  you can have as many false positives and false negatives really, of course if you have a 80% chance of being AI this is sus, but you cannot use this as a fact, it's like saying \"you are so good that it cant be true\".\n\nThere is also the fact of luck, certain detectors are used to a \"certain style\" of writing, if you have a similar style or use tools that specifically have this style then you might be targetted.",
