    "body": "It's not just about the passive/active dichotomy, though. It's about the meaning created by piecing elements together. I like movies not because the plot met my expectations, but because all the elements together created an interesting experience that made me think and feel something - something I probably wouldn't come up with myself. It's ludicrous to think that with this new technology, I'll be able to produce cinematography better than Hoyte van Hoytema, for example. Of course, I won't, because I know nothing about it, just like I know nothing about directing, screenwriting, costume design, acting... I don't know how to create this kind of experience, even with unlimited resources, let alone with the resources provided by the CEO of OpenAI. These people are so arrogant, seriously, they will tell you absolutely anything to push their product. \ud83d\ude44 Already, there's a growing number of movie-goers who prefer practical effects and a 'conservative' use of CGI (looking at the numbers), so his perspective is, in my opinion, already outdated. He should build a time machine and sell it 15 years ago, not now, when we're at the 100th iteration of Marvel movies CGIed into oblivion. \ud83d\ude02",
