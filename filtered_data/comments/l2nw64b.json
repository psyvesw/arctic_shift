    "body": "I remember more than 10 years ago when I attended University, distinguished computer science and mechanical engineers students creating cool projects loved their workmanship but were very cautious of how to apply AI commercially if it would ever happen. Those times were great where people did stuff for the sake of doing stuff, not to try their lottery luck to get funds and become millionaire overnight with a title or a company name that has the word \u201cAI\u201d in it.\n\nTimes have changed a lot since then. I wholeheartedly think AI adds value, but we shouldn\u2019t build stuff without fundamentals when we commercialise a thing. It would bring a bad sentiment in this industry lowering the confidence of its promises and can lead to another AI winter due to that for expectations falling short.",
