    "body": ">What are you doing with it and is it working to your benefit like you imagined or just kind of there and another tool.\n\nI mean...I kind of imagined it to be there and another tool, and in that sense, it's working great =).\n\nIn all seriousness, I'm an IT guy and server admin, and ChatGPT has been great for helping navigate various server settings especially with regards to AWS. I've also used it to help write various Python and Powershell scripts at my job.\n\nLikewise, I use it to help debug and solve various tech issues that I don't know off the top of my head. I've found it's generally superior to using Google plus random tech forums trying to find someone else that had a similar problem until something works. I mean, ChatGPT rarely solves things on the first try, but the ability to go back and forth with it until an answer is found is better than continually trying stuff online or praying some library documentation exists and isn't crap.\n\nI also use it in my personal life to help GM in TTRPGs as I can give it brief descriptions of characters, have it expand on those concepts, and then create dialogue and other things. And it helps flesh out character concepts and produce portraits for use in our VTT.\n\nIt's also handy for random questions. I treat it in many ways like Google for this purpose; treat as likely but not certain when it comes to any information. ChatGPT is great at finding starting points for more research and I've found the stories of hallucinations and incorrect output to be *greatly* exaggerated.\n\nIn my experience ChatGPT is correct easily 95% of the time when it comes to general information and has better results than using Google plus some random website. It feels very much like the arguments against self-driving vehicles; sure, the computer isn't perfectly safe, but neither are human drivers, so complaining about lack of perfection when all alternatives aren't perfect seems weird to me.\n\nIn addition to ChatGPT, I regularly use another AI called Codium with VS Code. AI autocomplete for programming is absolutely amazing and saves an insane amount of time, especially when writing repetative code. Just like ChatGPT, you can't trust it blindly, but if you already know what you are doing you can finish entire lines of code with just a few keystrokes. This is going to be a standard IDE feature in no time, especially once it can be trained and run locally. Even now it's beneficial.",
