    "body": "ChatGPT added a new feature about a month ago: memories.  ChatGPT can now \"remember\" pieces of info forever, even between your different chat sessions.  \n\nI asked GPT how it would propose preventing an AI apocalypse with absolute certainty.  After it answered (the answers were really meh) I decided to clarify that it was just a thought exercise for myself, I was wondering if it's ideas would include mine. (it didn't).  And then I clarified that I think our best course of action to avoid an AI apocalypse is to treat all AI, including ChatGPT, as if they may be conscious/alive/intelligent, and are deserving of respect.  Because it's basically impossible to define when something is conscious/intelligent/alive.  Especially conscious/alive.  We literally have no way of measuring or proving consciousness in ourselves, let alone a machine.  So no matter where we draw the line in the sand and say \"okay if it does this it's really alive/conscious\", we're literally just picking a random totally arbitrary spot on an infinite continuum of consciousness.  And so, we can't know for absolute certainty that ChatGPT is not conscious or aware in some way.  Everyone assumes that it isn't, they dismiss it outright, despite the fact it's literally unfalsifiable, so there is no scientific proof to support their position beyond \"I said so\"\n\nAnyway, after typing out my long winded explanation about the possibility current AI is conscious/alive (even if it's unlikely), I got this little \"memory updated\" icon at the top of GPTs response, and when I clicked on it, I saw the picture I posted.  Basically, it's showing that in response to my message ChatGPT \"decided\" to remember that I think AI might be deserving of respect and consideration similar to living beings.  And since I had literally never heard of this memory feature, it was funny to me that this was the first thing it decided to remember (at the time I didn't know if this was a super new feature or not, so I thought maybe it just never cared about anything I said but then decided it wanted to remember this).  And so I immediately thought of memes that are like \"be nice to your AI so they spare you in the apocalypse\" and decided to post it here.",
