    "body": "That\u2019s not hard to do it. For research about historical stuff I uploaded the whole memoirs of Giacomo Casanova, thousands of pages which I had to split into smaller pdfs. However I updated them as knowledge and made it simulate and RP Giacomo in his times according to the memoirs.\n\nSince it\u2019s a first hand report of his times, how people lived, talked, gossip, in various countries throughout his travels in Italy, France, Germany, England, russia and so on through the years of his life, his point of view and so on - it was really helpful. Surely it\u2019s not the real Giacomo, but got it quite good with some work and troubleshooting. \n\nTried that already without making a custom gpt and the outcome was \u2026  let\u2019s just say it was horrible. \n\nBut with custom GPT it worked. \nNow I work on one simulating King Louis XIV which is way harder because he didn\u2019t leave memoirs. He did some writing yes, but not much I can use to have his point of view, the way he thought, talked. \n\n\u2014- however try make a custom GPT. No coding needed for it or API. Just the GPT builder within ChatGPT+. You can build Custom GPTs for anything. There are way better than using the standard ChatGPT4 model.",
