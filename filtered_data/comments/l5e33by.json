    "body": "Hey, I Tried Poe briefly before, and I have been looking into perplexity recently. Would you mind tell me what your experience is with them a little bit more, in terms of comparison? For example, is Poe better than creating custom gpts for stuff like large text analysis? \n\nI am a teacher and use chatGPTplus (not the API) basically for lesson planning, brainstorming, writing samples for assessment modelling, and as a marking assistant to read student work, grade it and provide feedback with suggestions for improvement, based on my feeding it rubrics and samples. \n\nGPT has not been so great at the marking stuff and larger text analysis (around 2000 words). It does not seem to use the rubric consistently, grades are all too similar for very different work, and after some time just gets worse. Can't even maintain consistency in the format it uses to give me feedback. Do you think Poe or Perplexity would be better for my use case? Thanks and sorry if that's asking too much",
