    "body": "Thanks for the suggestions and the offer to help! I really appreciate it.\n\nTo provide a bit more context, I'm currently studying for my nursing school finals, which are coming up in just 2 weeks. My professor's PowerPoint presentations are the main source material I'm working with, but they're quite confusing. I was hoping to use GPT to create flashcards from the content to help me study more effectively.\n\nI've been dealing with some personal challenges recently, including my dad's stroke and some issues with my job not allowing me to take PTO when I needed it. As a result, my grades have taken a hit, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed trying to catch up and prepare for these exams.\n\nIf you're still willing to help with a Python script to generate flashcards from the PowerPoint content, I would be incredibly grateful. I can send you a sample of the slides to work with. Alternatively, if you have any other suggestions for tools or strategies to create effective study materials quickly, I'm open to any ideas you might have.\n\nI wanted to mention that English is my second language, so I've used GPT to help me compose this response and ensure that I'm communicating clearly. I hope this doesn't cause any confusion or inconvenience.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to offer your support and expertise. It means a lot to me, especially given the challenging circumstances I'm facing. :)",
