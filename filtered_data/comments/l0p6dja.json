    "body": "There. Since you want to argue.... I copied and pasted what you were replying to.  You COMPLETELY MADE UP that I statrted my statement with \"I think they are a narcissist.\" You made.it.up.  & when youre called out for making things up THEN you what the actual prompt? Learn how to read. You are the case and point: \n\n \"Oh fudge. Based on my experience with \"humans\" I didn't think anyone would ask for follow up questions.  Lol. I asked the legal questions on reddit under an Alt account cause they were specific so let me think of an example that wont DOX me.\n\nOk. This is not as straight forward as the legal questions but: \n   I got involved with someone & started to think they were a narcissist. Everything fit for a narcissist but after he broke up with me, I thought he was low key stalking me. And that confused me because my initial thinking was that a narcissist would never put that much effort into someone other than themselves. However, I still thought he was both a Narcissist and stalking me. So I asked \"psych people\" who were like \"No, a narcissit wouldn't stalk you once they leave you. Once they're done they're done.\" My spidey senses were going off so I asked ChatGPT & it was like \"Narcissists can have control issues and feel a sense if ownership towards a person. They can continue to monitor a person out of a sense of ownership or even to interfere with the person's life if they feel slighted.\" AI said it better. But it made sense. So it's not about ME but his sense of owning me which oddly makes sense and ChapGPT explained it better than \"psych peop\" who I think should've know this.\"",
