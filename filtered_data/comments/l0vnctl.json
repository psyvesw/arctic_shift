    "body": "Teacher here, I am adapting. I am using a GPT API that allows me to give my students a rubic with suggeted material for their essays. They write their first draft themselves and get feedback on their essays from the GPT-App. Because I fed it good data it helps the students with suggestions and alternatives. They use these suggestions to work on their essays again. It is a fair compromise imo and the students learn to use LLMs as a tool in a guided but still super engaging way. Mind you I am teacher age 9 and 10 so they are still more motivated to do their school work anyway but I feel like this sets them up nicely to work with LLMs as an assitance instead of trying to hide it from them. \n\nFor me as a teacher it is awesome because it creates a clear and objective writing goal. With essays or stories it is always so hard to grade and explain your marks. This helps me tremendously on setting the expected work, gives my students guidance in getting there and gives so much better feedback in a much faster time than I ever could.",
