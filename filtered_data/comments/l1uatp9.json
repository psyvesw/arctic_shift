    "body": "Pure convenience.. By using chatgpt plus+ over and over again I've become an \"expert\" at understanding how it wants to be prompted. I know when it lies, and how to phrase questions for it not to lie. I know how its copyright guardrails get triggered and how to make sure they don't etc. The custom gpt feature has been a total gamechanger for me as a solopreneur as well, allowing me to have access to various digital interns , research assistants, tutors , that are specially tweaked for my needs, as well as 3rd party gpt's that go way beyond. \n\nAlso, when i want to brainstorm ideas i can even have a phone call with chatgpt while out for a walk. And when I'm done, the transcript is there for me to review. \n\nI've yet to see other platforms come close to what chatgpt offers as a suite. \n\nI am however looking forward to trying Claude one day, if it ever becomes available in Europe. But I don't know if it has the same breadt and depth of features.",
