But it\u2019s here and it\u2019s here to stay and it\u2019ll only get better.\n\nIf you really wanted to learn the things you\u2019re prompting, you could just ask ChatGPT to go more in depth on the topic at hand or explain it you in easier terms, maybe throw in some analogies.\n\nChatGPT is whatever you make it. An assistant, an employee, a teacher, you just need to use it in a way that compliments the outcome you want and use it with that specific intention.\n\nAnother thing too is- the topics you find yourself to be lacking in, id recommend putting yourself in scenarios where you can put it to practice.",
