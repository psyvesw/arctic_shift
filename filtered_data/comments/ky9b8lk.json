    "body": "That\u2019s how my kids use it too. I actually introduced them to ChatGPT before they or their teachers had even heard about it. I told them about how hysterical their schools would get about it, so they were always one step ahead.\n\nNow they use it for inspiration (and some grunt work) and they\u2019ll never get caught for plagiarism because they understand and appreciate the kind of tool it is.\n\nMy eldest recently expressed a great deal of satisfaction with a paper she turned in and how well it represented her views because she has messed around with ChatGPT enough that she can now clearly spot dull, uninspired phrasing, and this has made her more creative.",
