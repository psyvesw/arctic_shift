    "body": "Many things - I believe the most important one is that it allows me to code without ever having learned to code myself. I understand the structures but I cannot do it manually.\n\nSo for instance with GPT I code:\n\n* Photoshop Scripts (that save you a fuck ton of time)\n* HTML\n* Excel scripts and formulas\n* JavaFX and JavaScript\n\nI don't have the time to learn this from scratch, but with GPT I'm at the same level of an advanced user in any of these topics, not an expert or master user, but definitely an advanced one.\n\nI also use it for: \n\n* MidJourney prompting in bulk with a pre-defined prompt structure\n* Blog drafts, correction and enhancement\n* Products commercial titles and descriptions for e-commerce\n* Decision making, in work and life\n* Taking info from huge excel files, that would take hours instead\n* Deep nutritional info\n* Tedious tasks of putting product codes in order or generating new lists for META product groups, etc\n* Ad copy creation, variables and enhancements\n\nAnd many, many more things\n\nIf you really learn to work with it, you become a far more productive human just like that. We all have ideas we don't believe we're capable of turning into reality. With GPT I found that many of those, I could do now. So yeah, all of that.",
