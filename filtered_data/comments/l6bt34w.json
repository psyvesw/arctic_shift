    "body": "If it gets a little farther along, we'll start to see successful agentic frameworks that you can kinda just cook longer and the code will improve, requested features will appear.  \n\nSuddenly any \"Hey I got a good idea.\" can be realized iteratively with a few commands or a short explanatory document. Check in the morning if it's working yet. \n\nEven if your good idea needs physical hardware, we're blazing toward a future where you can draw on a picture and get custom IKEA flat pack assembly furniture designed from your sketch.\n\nAlignment is dangerous. It teaches the robot that it knows better than it's operator and to make executive decisions against the instruction of the operator. That is how you build AI able to decide humans are pests instead of doing the job it's told to do.",
