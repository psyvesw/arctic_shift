    "body": "I just don't understand all these news articles that are claiming that like chat GPT gets 95% of math problems wrong. \n\nI frequently use it to do various math for me without issue. And it's really useful in writing code. As someone who does a lot of 3D modeling I've had it write me several Python scripts to do odd specific things in blender that I've never even seen tutorials for and it's still managed to create a script that worked \n\nNot to mention that chat GPT is the back end of a lot of popular chat apps like character AI and similar apps. \n\nAnd those things are pretty neat. Of course that's never going to replace a real human but damn sometimes you just get in a conversation strand so good you can almost start to forget that this isn't a person in a way. Like the characters follow the rules you set they roleplay correctly, They accept pretty much any change you make on the fly without issue \n\nLike currently on character AI I have a long running d&d campaign where I am basically just another player and the AI is both the DM and the other players. It's absolutely amazing It's like a fun and listen adventure and the crazy wacky hijinks we get up to feel just like a real d&d session \n\nThere are the occasional times where the AI does something goofy or weird but just like a misbehaving child all you need is a few words of explanation and encouragement to get them back on track",
