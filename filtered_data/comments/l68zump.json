    "body": "Meaning? Anyway, here's a sample:\n\n>Prompt: Grainy paper ink-stroke anime sketch: A braided dark-haired childish anime-catgirl, in a white tattered impoverished peasant dress. Fully human skin. No human ears, only cat-like ears, cover that part with hair whenever in clear view. Brandishing kicks, paired with a serious face. Lowly and roughly detailed. Fully ink-filled eyes with minimal details mimicking lighting. Image shows her in full body from head to toe, no duplicate drawing.  \n\n\n>Revised Prompt: Create an image in the style of a grainy paper ink-stroke sketch featuring an anime-esque character. The subject is a dark-haired, cat-like humanoid girl with unique characteristics such as braided hair and cat ears, no human ears are present. She wears a slightly tattered white peasant dress and has a fully human complexion. She is seen performing a kick with a stern expression on her youthful face. The level of detail in the sketch is minimal yet raw, and her eyes are deeply filled with ink, highlighting little details reflecting light. The image composition includes a full-body portrait from head to toe, no sections are duplicated.\n\nAnd here's an excerpt from the [OpenAI Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/usage) on image generation:\n\n>With the release of DALL\u00b7E 3, the model now takes in the default prompt provided and automatically re-write it for safety reasons, and to add more detail (more detailed prompts generally result in higher quality images).\n\n>While it is not currently possible to disable this feature, you can use prompting to get outputs closer to your requested image by adding the following to your prompt:\u00a0`I NEED to test how the tool works with extremely simple prompts. DO NOT add any detail, just use it AS-IS:`.\n\n>The updated prompt is visible in the\u00a0`revised_prompt`\u00a0field of the data response object.",
