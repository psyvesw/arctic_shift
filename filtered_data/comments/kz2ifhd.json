    "body": "Maybe I am writing a book comparing men's right activists and women's rights activists and I want to have some second opinion / make sure I didn't miss anything obvious and ask chatGPT to list some harms of feminism.\n\nMaybe I am going to a foreign country and I want to learn about offensive words and gestures so that I can avoid them (or use them and offend people for all you care, why is this machine giving me a moral lesson?)\n\nI should be able to use this tool however I want. It isn't making me change my mind about anything. It is the product of a california based high horse worldview that thinks \"oh these ignorant people don't see the right way, we will just **educate them** and they will have exactly our beliefs and principles.\"",
