    "body": "It's weird because I'm an author and I have a love/hate relationship with ChatGPT. I love it because I'm using it constantly to research things and help me improve passages of my writing, but...then I did it. The cardinal writing sin: **I asked ChatGPT to write a passage for me.**\n\nEspecially as the technology has advanced, this...kind of ruined me. Because as Sturgeon's Law states, \"90% of everything is crap\". I never made any delusions that I was outside of that 90%, but at least in past iterations of ChatGPT, its writing might have come off as amateurish or even bad. But I think it's really improved drastically.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that...ChatGPT is simply a better writer than me. In terms of the quality of my work, I've become completely spoiled by it. I'm in a bit of a conundrum, the way I see it: I could do my own writing without the help of ChatGPT and it'll be \"honest\", but it won't be good. Or I could use ChatGPT to improve my writing and even just straight-up give me passages, but then it's like...it's not even my work. Even if I revise and change it, it's still just modifying something that an AI wrote.\n\nSo...in all honesty, I've been tempted to just stop writing. Whatever fiction I would want to write, ChatGPT can do it better. I am completely convinced of this.\n\nI guess I could still write things that ChatGPT can't, for example an autobiography, or my own personal perspective on real-world topics (nonfiction), but...it just feels kind of pointless now.\n\nDo I make art for its own sake, knowing it's mediocre or worse? Or do I ask a Chatbot to write and edit for me and feel like a fraud? Neither option is good.",
