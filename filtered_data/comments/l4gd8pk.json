    "body": "When you write about an ideas, statements, thoughts, claims etc\u2026 that others came up with you need to cite them. You give credit to them and let the reader know that while this is part of your paper, others came up with various ideas and agree with it. This helps give validity and credibility to your paper. \n\nIn other words citing supports everything you say, so that people don\u2019t think you are talking out of your butt.\n\nUsing Chat GPT to generate direction for a paper is probably ok, but you have to understand that any AI is getting their information from other sources. It\u2019s no different than reading a paper to generate ideas/ use points from it. So I\u2019m not sure if you would cite ChatGpt or ask it where it got that info from. You should ask a professor.",
