    "body": "We\u2019ve been using it differently. I am a teacher, and I\u2019ve been teaching it to make materials that are engaging and appropriate for my lessons. I have over 20 years of teaching experience. I am using AI not so much to help me understand, but to help me explain and create. In these cases, I know what I am looking for, but a little training and collaboration can help add missing elements, fine-tune level, make intelligent questions. I definitely cannot deploy what it does without careful review, but that\u2019s also just my part in the collaboration. I find that it takes some back and forth to get better results, but once those results are achieved, in GPT 4, it can reproduce those better results consistently going forward. \n\nTeachers are traditionally a very slow to adapt group, but I feel this is game-changing tech for us because it rewards clear, patient, explanations, reiterated in different ways, with examples.  I have been making the \u201cprompts\u201d since the 20th century. I call them \u201cassignments\u201d and \u201cfeedback for revision\u201d.",
