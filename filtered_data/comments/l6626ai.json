    "body": "> Everyone has a computer, why aren't we all computer programmers now?\n\nI was a WordPress developer for ten years. I believe in continuing education, so it's not like I was sitting on my thumb and spinning, but for the last five of those years I was so busy my learning consisted of \"I know that simply because someone asked me to make it so I had to.\"\n\nLater, I started learning just a smidge about Next.js and React and ran into a WordPress job board posting where someone asked if they should make the thing they wanted to in WordPress. I advised them against it and gave them some pointers on how to handle the kinds of applicants they would be running into (since my last major job was from that same board, and the people who hired me told me how and why I stood out).\n\nThey asked me, if I had my druthers, how would I make it instead, if not WP? I told them as much as I knew and wished them well, but they asked why I couldn't just be the one to help them out in the non-WP way. I emphasized my lack of experience, and they asked me to do it anyway since the teeny tiny version of what they wanted to make only needed to be a minimal version to shop around. \n\nThey gave me the spec, it seemed doable, and I was being honest about my limits and inexperience, so I took it.\n\nThey kept throwing new things at me and I kept being able to say yes, so we eventually made the first version of the project.\n\nIt was a trial by before, because I wrote code before and had decent ideas but having to track anything and everything, and educate myself for the sake of it was a whole new level of experience as a developer. I wasn't customizing existing things or stapling two things together. I was learning patterns, data structures, etc.\n\nAnyway, last year YouTube recommended me this video of this guy who worked for Netflix and he said, and I am paraphrasing, any video, tutorial or guide that says stuff like \"learn Javascript in six weeks\" is horseshit. He said, you will not have learned it in six weeks and even in six months, you'll still be pretty bad. It might take you two years to be *decent*.\n\nAt first I wasn't totally sure what he was getting at, but there is this sort of thing that happens in your brain where you go \"oh, THAT is how that works\" or \"THAT is why that is working\" even if it's a concept or construct you've used dozens or maybe even hundreds of times.\n\nSorry. Not sure why your comment turned me into a ramble factory. A little lonely but also wanted to share that perspective :)\n\nYou start to understand it as a *language* and not just a programming language.\n\nI think this chat stuff is a bit like that. I had an opportunity to play with GPT-3 in the playground back when they were doling out free credits. I wanted to play with it just to be able to form my own opinion by interacting with it directly so that I didn't have to rely on other people's opinions or spins to understand the role it might play in my life or the world's.\n\nI think I have honed a way of working with it in the, who knows, thousand conversations?....where I am so dialed in that I get the same janky results from time to time as all of us, because some of that is independent of who's using it, like blind spots in training, etc. But holy fucking shit do I get incredible mileage from it when it's meeting me int he right spot, which is fortunately most of the time. And when it's shitty, I, like most of us, have a sense of when to scrap and start over.\n\nI am not gonna be one of those people that says \"skill issue\" or \"your prompting sucks\" because I don't think of them as prompts. I'm talking like myself, just with a filter, and carefully, and I sort of am always finding the sweet spot between giving it enough to steer it, and narrowly scope where I want it to end up, and not so much that it starts to become dumb because I've cut into its ability to respond fully, or where I've said so damn much (like now, sorry) where it is too much into a box.\n\nI think if everyone can find that sweet spot for themselves they'll squeeze more from it where they'll be happier with its effectiveness. I ask it work-related concept things (notsomuch for code, but ideas on how to handle things), occasionally history and literature stuff, and random trivia things when discussing things with family or friends. I am fortunate to have the money for Plus so I want to squeeze all I can out of it and on balance, for me and the way I write and for what it knows, it's the best on balance (although, no sarcasm, Pi.ai is amazing in terms of its casual tone, although the weird emoji-lite personality is over the top for some people haha)\n\nAnd actually, *because* you sometimes have to lead it, it's made me better at asking questions overall; I am more, er, Socratic? in terms of building my logic when I lay things out.",
