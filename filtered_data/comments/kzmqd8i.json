    "body": "Not sure about this. I've seen people [teach entirely new languages](https://maximumeffort.substack.com/p/i-taught-chatgpt-to-invent-a-language) to GPT-4 and it's capable of outputting sentences in that new language. \n\nYes it does have a lot of known limitations I won't deny that. It is bad at basic arithmetic and backwards inference. Also, it's forced to give answers even when it has a low confidence score... tuning ChatGPT to be more accurate also makes it less likely to give you answers it knows... this tradeoff may not be fixable because it's a real life one. Basically ChatGPT is penalized more in training for not giving an answer than for giving a wrong one and showing its work.\n\nI know that the fundamental unit of ChatGPT is quite simple. It's just some matrix multiplications on many-dimensional vectors. But how complex is a single neuron? How many bits of information describe the computational part of a neuron? A few, sure, but when do neurons go from being simple electrochemical repeaters to \"intelligence\"?",
