    "body": "The efficiency point is irrelevant as time progresses and your points still inculcate openai in lawsuits. You're thinking about this like a software engineer but you have to think about it like a business owner.\n\nThose \"in their right mind\" are data scientists, of course, and they'd go about it differently. But millions of people, potentially billions in the future, are using the tool who are not data scientists are inefficiently scraping the web with the tool and those like it. \n\nModDB isn't going to seek lawsuits, but CNN, Fox News, NYT, or anyone with a legal department might or will. They'd see the origin as webgpt, file lawsuit and legally obtain the purpose of the plugin itself. You won't be able to say in court that \"it's a webscraping tool\" without mentioning \"OpenAI's ChatGPT.\" That will bring the eye of sauron upon them, and that's why stuff like this is problematic.\n\nPerhaps it's critical that the websites see openai as the source of the query because that's who they may have agreements with.\n\nBesides all that, yea it's my opinion. You posted a video to reddit up in arms about wtf they're doing. So, here's my opinion from some guy on reddit. Feel free to shit on it as I really don't care, but it's just my advice. I'm not in this to win some argument, just to provide feedback. I'll not read your reply. Best of luck!",
