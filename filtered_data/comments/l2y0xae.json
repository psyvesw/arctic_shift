    "body": "AI is a tool. An extremely powerful one. It depends on *how* you use it. If you're using it to try and hurt others, that's wrong. If you're using it to explain your thoughts better, that's good. \n\nYou're using it in a very good fashion. Language is messy. I love that we have AI to help us communicate nowadays.\n\nAnd a lot of people are afraid of it because they don't understand it. Don't listen to them. *They* are wrong, not you. It's still an extremely new piece of technology and it will take a while for people to get used to it.\n\nBe careful of using it an academic setting though. A lot of people are getting wrongfully accused of \"cheating\" with AI nowadays via \"AI detectors\", which are built on \"technology\" that isn't exactly possible.\n\n\\-=-\n\nTagalog is a fascinating language. I've always been a fan of how it sounds. And oddly enough, my best friend is half Filipino.\n\n\\-=-\n\nI'll give it a look here in a bit.\n\n**Keep looking for other solutions in the meantime though. I'm not 100% sure I can provide what you're looking for, but I'm at least interested in trying.**",
