    "body": "oh that won't happen, that'd be a waste of time and resources. in the same way most people didn't get trained before AI when their job became obsolete, most won't be retrained now.\n\nmy only advice to people is to find a job in an outdoor field requiring a lot of hands-on work, that probably won't be replaced for the foreseeable future. but any of those office jobs? an AI can probably learn to do them within the next five, especially now that they can recognize visuals so well. It wouldn't surprise me if they took things from 'chatbot when devs are off the clock' to 'full-time voiced AI customer support' very soon. \n\nit's always the lower income bracket that's hit the hardest with these developments. maybe AI should be trained on solving sociological issues like that, it feels like that ought to be a priority considering how many people will be shafted by its adoption.",
