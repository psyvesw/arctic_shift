    "body": "Sounds like you might be asking it for too much at once. The more focused the task, the better the output. \n\nTry asking it for fewer questions at a time. Or better yet, have it generate some questions first, and then prompt it again afterwards to make the questions multiple choice. \n\nYou get a certain amount of brain power per response. If one response requires the AI to:\n1. Read the test content for the first time\n2. Come up with good questions based on the content and any other instructions you added\n3. Come up with the answers to the questions it generated\n4. Come up with alternate answers that are plausible but incorrect\n5. Arrange those answer choices randomly like you'd like\n6-?. Repeat most of those at steps to give you multiple questions all at once\n\nYou are stretching the brain power pretty thin across every aspect of that. Break it into pieces, and the conversation history will improve quality of future outputs. \n\nIf I was doing this, I wouldn't even ask for questions on the first message. I'd say \"Hey, I'm working on creating a test on a short story we're reading in the AP Lang class I teach. Here is the story [story]. Before we get into creating the test, let's make sure we're acquainted with the content. What do you think are the most important aspects of the story? What concepts would be beneficial to focus on with students? \n\n(Alternatively if you already have a focused plan, mention those concepts that you have been teaching)\n\nThen it will give you a nice response showing an understanding of the content and a good teaching PoV. This means not only that the AI won't have to ingest the content for the first time, but its own response summarizing the content will improve its ability on the next response. Then I'd ask to generate some questions. Tweak or get more questions if I want. And it would be last that I ask it to throw in some wrong answers to make it MC.",
