I just simply choose not to write it from scratch because I rather spend time doing other things that I enjoy. I don't enjoy the current topics. This is how I am able to proofread and fact check the writing AI produces. If I was incompetent, I don't think that would work out as well for me. Besides, essay writing is quite ambiguous so you kind of have to make sure it produced a paper that you would submit yourself.",
