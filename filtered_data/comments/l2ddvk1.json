    "body": "It would be hundreds of lines and the errors aren't obvious to a casual glance, here are some examples:\n\nRemaning things - I had a c# method for controlling the rotation of bones in an armature, using LookAt(). This used a slerp function, with var such as 'slerpSpeed'. When I asked for a small revision to part of this method, all the vairables had their names changed, the class was now capatalised.\n\nBreaking general functionality - I have too many examples of this. Say I have a class that controls an NPC. This includes states, such as idle, attack, follow, flee. Let's say I have a switchbox in Update() that checks which state the NPC is in and does stuff. Now, if I ask GPT to do something like \"please change the attack logic to simply play an animation, rather than send an attack request in. Make only this change, no other, and give me an updated Update() method), I 100% guarantee it will break something unrelated. Maybe now in Idle state the NPC no longer calls the Awareness method to check for players around it, and now Awareness is called outside the switchbox. It can't help but **TINKER**.\n\nGoldfish memory. I'll say something like \"Here are two methods. Take the parts of method 1 that acheive X and include them in method 2\". It will make an attempt. If I feedback that it failed, it will try a rewrite that's usually much longer and complex, and also fails. By the 3rd or 4th attempt, it's abandoned the origional question, and now all other functionality of the two methods are gone.",
