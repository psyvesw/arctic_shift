ChatGPT is very helpful for some tasks, like generating ideas for lesson plans or feedback comments that students/parents never read anyway, but I'm the only teacher at my school that uses it (or admits to it, anyway). Nearly all the other teachers just think it is a stupid tool that only kids use to cheat on homework (which happens, but 90% of the homework teachers give out is pretty useless, anyway). \n\nMost regular people can't think of much use for an LLM or MMLM aside from asking it the same random-ass things they would ask Alexa or Siri or Google Assistant like \"a yo so like how do i make a million dollar asap\".",
