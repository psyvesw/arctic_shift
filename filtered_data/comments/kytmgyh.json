    "body": "Hey, here\u2019s a fun theory:\n\n-Hogaak, a problem ban card which dominated Magic: The Gathering\u2019s popular Modern format, abuses a game mechanic called Delve.\n\n-Delve was first introduced in Magic back in the early 2000s, which is right where we see the first visible incline on this graph for the frequency of the word\u2019s appearance.\n\n-Magic\u2019s primary audience is the college-age crowd.\n\n-Hogaak was printed during 2019, and shortly thereafter, Magic received another boost in popularity thanks to the pandemic.\n\n-Notice how there\u2019s a slight uptilt in usage of \u2018delve\u2019 in academic papers in 2019, which continues for a few years until that sudden spike starting in 2022, as the generation who spent several years in college post-hogaak are now publishing papers.\n\nNow, you might think this explanation is ridiculous, and it kind of is, being based more on speculation and correlation than any hard evidence of causation. But, so is the assumption that this spike is ai-driven. The graph looks all dramatic but we\u2019re still talking about a fraction of a percent of academic papers, here. Language is a living thing and words phasing in and out of popularity is totally normal.\n\nImagine someone pointing at a graph where more and more people are using the word \u2018based\u2019 over the last few years and shrieking that this must be the work of AI. You\u2019d clearly think they\u2019re crazy. The uptick is because the word has caught on, among real people, for completely unrelated reasons.\n\nIf they want to prove that \u2018delve\u2019 is a surefire sign of AI generated text, they\u2019d be posting statistics where they had chatGPT generate a few thousand papers and show the percentage of them in which the word appeared. But they aren\u2019t providing that evidence, because they\u2019d rather just make up bullshit.",
