    "body": "My snarky comment suggests that you must know better; so go apply.\n\nIf there is one thing my medical training has taught me, it is to assess a situation before coming to a conclusion. We don't have nearly enough information to come to your conclusion. If it made really good business sense for them to do this or that, then it stands to reason they 'might' do it. Since they haven't, there might be any number of reasons why they haven't. 1. They intend to.  2. There are reasonable reasons we aren't aware of.  3. Reasonable reasons we can't speculate about because they aren't obvious to non-insiders.\n\nI'm gainfully employed and get $20 a month of usefulness from my subscription, so I'm not on the edge and thus caught up in complaining about what they should or shouldn't be doing.\n\nI don't run out of 'quota', and my friends that subscribe don't either, unless they are lying, of course. I've read that if you try to get the AI to do naughty stuff, you will get 'cut off' and you will have a reduced quota. Maybe that's what is causing your problem?",
