    "body": "Eh, does anyone, really? What does it matter?\n\nHonestly curious. I can't recall a time in my life for any free service or product which I hesitated to use due to realizing or just outright knowing that I was the product.\n\nYet, people talk about the importance of this sentiment as if they're intelligently escaping their own murder. Thus the value seems awfully melodramatic to me, hence my curiosity--what does it matter to be aware of this? What are the perks of knowing this and how important are they, actually?\n\nLet's say I use ChatGPT-4o for free. Okay now they have information about me and might even sell it, I guess. Due to this, is there supposed to be a meaningful negative impact in my life that I'm supposed to notice at some point?\n\nHell, usually I just notice that advertisements get personalized and thus become way more useful to me, which is great. At worst (though rarely), maybe I get junk mail because of something free I used, which I just, well, take a moment to toss in the trash.\n\nSo, again, the sentiment rings pretty meaningless to me, at least in any practical sense. But I'm pretty dumb so if I'm taking on significant risks or ignorant to other values here, I'd like someone to break it down for me to learn.",
