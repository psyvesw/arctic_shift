I once saw a FB ad for a soon-to-open sixth form centre [16-18 years old] at a school which credited the images to Midjourney) - rather than recruiting real-life children from nearby schools, seeking parental consent, procuring uniforms 9-12 months before the scheduled opening (so way before the bulk order) etc., especially given increasing concerns / paranoia about using images of children online; hone a selection of prompts to generate images of fictional children (maybe even from a more diverse demographic range than the local population) in a generic school setting, wearing a uniform that looks vaguely like what they're planning to introduce...",
