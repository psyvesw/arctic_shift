    "body": "Pessimistic take, but I can see where you're coming from at least.\n\nI think the ultimate evolution of this tech for personal use is going to be true customization, hopefully on a local device or service to alleviate people's fears of Big Data. Sounds like you want that sort of impersonal but highly functional kind of Star Trek system; I want something a little more like Rommie or Cortana or Jarvis, something that has a personality, some snark. I also want AI avatars for the same reason, I want to be able to prescribe a whole appearance and personality to the system that's got it tentacles into every aspect of my digital life (which it has to have, if it's going to actually be useful in my day to day). \n\nOf course more than any of that I want actual useful *purpose* right now. All of these AI are informational at best, which is great but I need more.",
