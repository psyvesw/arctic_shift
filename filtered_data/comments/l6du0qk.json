Put a little effort into getting the ball rolling.\n3) paste in your college\u2019s grade rubric so it knows what the school is expecting.\n4) paste in whole articles that you think fits the content you\u2019re writing.\n5) then ask it to create an improved outline and give it some details on what you expect.\n6) fine tune the outline by talking to it like a person until you have a good outline.\n7) export this outline as markup to import into a mindmap software. Xmind is good.\n8) now find articles yourself that has good information for your essay.  \n9) paste these into ChatGPT and tell it to pick out the fits well with your outline and include the APA citation so you know where it came from.\n10) now once you have a great outline with great snippets from the articles of interest with their citations go to your mindmap and start writing your essay.  It should easy at this point because you have an exact template and data to use with citations ready to go.\n11) Once you\u2019re writing paste your final essay back to ChatGPT and ask it to review it and provide feedback/corrections.",
