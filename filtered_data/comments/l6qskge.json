    "body": "Dude\u2026 if this shot keeps up\u2026 I really don\u2019t understand people understand how many jobs will disappear or near disappear. Do you think those B rated content creators and movie producers will still have any views compared to AIs being able to literally vomit better quality movies and content, music etc at a humanly unsustainable rate? \n\nI think I\u2019ll use this inbetween jobs phase to start really focusing on a new job that involves AI. As a teacher, I have no idea how long it\u2019ll take before AI can someone take over my job, but I better start learning something else, because I still have got more than 35ish years before I retire and I doubt my job will be safe for that long.",
