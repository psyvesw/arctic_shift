    "body": "Wow, thank you so much for your detailed and thoughtful reply! These are incredible ideas! I really appreciate how much time you took out to help me and my students out. These days, I mostly teach college English 101 and 102 courses, so lots of writing, reading, and critical thinking. I\u2019m trying to get my students ahead of the curve when it comes to AI, prompting, and thinking about innovative ways to use AI, and beyond that, I\u2019m trying to do some novel things with them using AI. You bet I\u2019m going to do everything you detailed above and in your previous post with them! These are such great ideas and will help push their critical thinking, tech-savvy, and understanding in new directions. I love the last challenge regarding identifying fake citations, too\u2026 would be an incredible (and possibly incredibly frustrating, lol) group challenge for students to go through a list and figure out if they\u2019re correct or not while learning about MLA, APA, and research ethics. You\u2019re the best! Thank you again for sharing your ideas :).",
