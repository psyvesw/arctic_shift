    "body": "I actually wonder if that would be so absurd the world would revolt against the ruling class. Any more I actually doubt that. I also know civilizations have risen and fallen and have essentially been wiped off the map. Many like the ancient Egyptians, vikings, whatever was before the Mayans, Atlantis. Whatever happens to them we only really speculate and always assume no civilization was as advanced as ours. I kinda just think that whatever happens it wipes out knowledge and technology. It doesn't wipe every human off of the face of the map but it sends humanity back to some level of the start over part of technology, world view and understanding (knowledge). Being very specific. Decay and the concept of lay to waste is something we need to understand. Paper disintegrates pretty quickly and the digital world is just a matter of distractions of servers or whatever. Why is there no evidence? Decay and distruction is a pretty good answer. An important point is what's under the ocean floor \ud83e\udd37 This might sound absurd to some but frankly a fake alien attacks Mysterio style is just as absurd. Whatever the one world folk say about just giving people a bunch of drugs and video games until they die is also quite absurd thinking. I don't see any of this ultimately rooted in the reality of human nature.\u00a0\n\n\nMy thoughts is always then what? What happens then? One world folks seem to think that their position is somehow permanent and will be so because of machines and ai. It's silly, really it just is.\u00a0",
