    "body": "Hmm well there are two credible hot takes for that. \n\nSome emotion is alright and quite honestly needed. So of course, a teenager admitting to ChaayGPT about suicidal thoughts shouldn't just get a blanket response of an emergency number only. A line or two of consoling thoughts would greatly add. \n\nBut at the same time, I don't think it should be to the extent that people start having AI partners and their own lives with it. That's just detrimental to mental health and humanity in the long run. \n\nAlso, if we're giving AI the ability to feel and understand human emotions, it'll (and already is based on news of men verbally abusing and negging their AI girlfriends) coming along with abuse. That will not age well.",
