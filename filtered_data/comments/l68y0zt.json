    "body": "It\u2019s not easy to accomplish what you\u2019re trying.  After realizing it isn\u2019t really possible without a huge amount of work for each prompt I wrote a web app to do it for me. \n\nMy app uses the API and it has about 35,000 lines of code as well as a database. It took me most of a year of spare time work to build it. And it does what you want. \n\nThere\u2019s a million things you can do with the api that can\u2019t be done on the OpenAI website. And it took several of them to make it happen. \n\nI think I can say with confidence that what you ask is not possible on their site. \n\nYou can teach it a writing voice to use, define both plots and subplots, and you could rewrite the prompt for page 156 and it could write it again and it would still fit between pages 155 and 157. \n\nBut almost no one knows how much they would need all that to really use chat for writing, so I\u2019m my only user and my site is not open to the public. \n\nIt also hasn\u2019t been skinned. \n\nI hope you get my point. What you\u2019re trying to do is really complicated.",
