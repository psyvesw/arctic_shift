    "body": "Idk about 12 months but we\u2019re getting there. A SAAS package I use daily for work has integrated LLM driven AI into their support bot. It\u2019s marginally more helpful than the search-based auto response that came before it, but if I have a problem that the training manual doesn\u2019t cover, I still need a human, which is about 4/5 times. So AI has offset maybe 20% of my personal inquiries. (The previous search-based automated tool never worked well, I always needed a person). This will absolutely change the CS industry before the end of the decade. And of course it\u2019s also coming for exec admins, remote assistants, paralegals, low stakes telemedicine (emotional support animals, medical marijuana cards, etc), and many other \u201cskilled support\u201d roles. As long as a skilled human can check the work and validate the learning data, the pieces certainly seem in place.",
