    "body": "Definitely has a quite similar degree of vocal fry. The accent sounds slightly different.\n\nSo presumably the voice is indeed modelled on hers. I wonder where one should draw the line of acceptability in imitation. You could think of this not unlike music covers, I suppose. A human covering another artist's music generally sounds sufficiently different that there aren't copyright issues. An AI \"covering\" the same piece is sampling from the original much in the same way that a human brain would, and implementing various style differentiation filters to come up with an original project that is reminiscent of the song being sampled. But if you tune those filters in a particular way, or remove them entirely (such that it just reproduces the original song), obviously that's infringement.\n\nCan individual identity survive in a post-AGI world?",
