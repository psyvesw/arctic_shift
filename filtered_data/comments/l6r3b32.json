    "body": "It's an expert in everything in your pocket.  Now think about thst at a large scale business.\n\nOptimal farming - soil analysis, weather patterns, crop yields, automated farming equipment, etc.  We could have a fully automated food source.\n\nNew cures for diseases are already being accelerated by AI if nothing but the analysis aspects.\n\nPeople with autism who can't read faces or tone can already use llms post conversation to learn more but soon in real time they can get feedback, same foe blond and deaf people.\n\nUniversal translators which understand context and expressions will be out very soon, maybe tomorrow's GPT update will include some of those features which were recently demo's.\n\nOn and on.  OP is right.  Most people really don't understand nor can they see the potential and are just chalking this up to hype.  \n\nOne last real example.  I can upload a sheet of data or point ChatGPT to a database, have it give me a summary of all the information, ask it endless questions without writing a line of code.  There are whole disciplines and scores of people who do that today and no lt as quickly not thoroughly.  I use this personally for finances, reviewing / questioning my jome insurance policy, analyzing eating and weigh habits,etc.  I have an army of analysts at my disposal which would cost hundreds of thousands to a big company.",
