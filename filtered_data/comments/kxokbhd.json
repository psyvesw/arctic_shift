    "body": "I've had to really think about why I am asking my students to write (or do any of my assignments).  What is it that I want them to learn or be able to do?  Because of that, some assignments have been totally revised.  More work takes place in class where we can discuss and I can provide learning support.  Relationships are important.  There has to be trust, in both directions, that we are trying to acomplish something important together.  In your case, practice theses and argument in class...or help them learn how to use AI to help them understand and practice thesis and argument.  Don't lose sight of generative AI as an impactful tutor.  Not accusing you of this, but if educators only look at this from the perspective of how to stop students from taking shortcuts, they have not thought enough about why they do what they do, and how to do it effectively.",
