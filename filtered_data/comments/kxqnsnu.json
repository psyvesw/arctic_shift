    "body": "Yep. Once this gets going, it's not going to be the great thing people seem to think. It's going to completely tank interest in this stuff. Like right now, this very moment you can go look at AI art. There's seemingly infinity pages of it to go consume. And tomorrow, another insane volume will be added to that same pile.  \n\nPeople think they got burned out on superhero movies cause they made like 40 of them over the course of a decade. What happens when a few hundred thousand (or millions) come out every day? By the time you wake up, 500,000 new LOTR remakes dropped. Even if only 1% are great, that's still 5000 versions on that one day alone. And it'll happen again the next day.",
