    "body": "I can\u2019t tell if you are being serious or not, and i apolagise if this is satrie but: Of course it\u2019s fake, that\u2019s the joke in the original person\u2019s message (because, unfortunetly, facebook is filled with older individuals who are usually more religious and usually fall for posts such as \u2018like this post or your going to hell\u2019 or also ai generated content, whether religious or not. That was the joke. The person said, are you stupid to you because, the joke (even if you don\u2019t get it) is obviously a joke (building of off the original comment) and obviously not stating that this photo is actually true. He wasn\u2019t asking \u2018are you stupid, of course this is true\u2019 but \u2018are you stupid, that\u2019s the most obvious thing ever\u2019 (no offence). Yes, anyone thinking that is infact true is stupid as you said, and that is the joke and that is why the person called you stupid. The post was not trying to mislead christians, it was trying to: show of a cool image that he was able to generate with AI; nor was the comment.\n\nNo offence, I get that this was just an oversight but\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.
