    "body": "You are right, and I'll admit I used a quite wide brush for effect. As I said in another reply though, as far as I understand the initiative for aformentioned improvements came from labour unions that had to fight hard for workers rights. \nIn the context of the modern world however, the fight isn't about things quite as dramatic as making sure Bob doesn't get a ton of molten steel accidentally dumped upon him after a 20-hour shift, but rather the fact that every production related breakthrough is turned into an accelerant to the widening chasm in compensation between labour and execs, while the average monetary value produced per hour by said labourers has multiplied many, many times over since the industrial revolution.\n\nUnions can, and are, fighting that fight as well of course, but gaining political support for that fight is a lot harder than in the example featuring our friend Bob.\n\nEven if we ignore that I mentioned the industrial revolution, we still have the mass introduction of cars and computers, as well as all AI advancements so far, that have all led to nothing of note to the average person's work-life balance. Something sure is trickling down, but it is yellow in colour and has a distinct smell.",
