    "body": "The issue is that, this is all currently. A calculator will never suddenly evolve the ability to solve Millenium Prize Problems. Similarly to how a hammer will never suddenly evolve the capability to hammer on its own.\n\nThe issue with GPT is that, while it is true that currently it cannot replace us, we haven't even started to SCRATCH at the level of performance we can get. We're still using old compute, and \"old\" architectures. Data is definitely a limiting factor, but you got a really highly movement of people spending trillions to make it not an issue. So yeah, currently it is a calculator (that knows more than me, and that I must prompt properly to learn what I need to do what I want.)\n\nBut it seems like it's only a matter of time before the thing is capable to replace even programmers. In fact, programming sounds like one of the easier things to replace considering code simulation and whatnot.",
