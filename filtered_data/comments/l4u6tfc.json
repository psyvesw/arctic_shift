    "body": "It\u2019s not an entirely passive affair, sometimes I don\u2019t like a particular direction it\u2019s gone, or I think there are better possibilities.\n\nWhen actually playing within the world it can of course have inconsistencies but as long as the big details are there it\u2019s not an issue. \n\nThe last time I played a scenario I stumbled across the home of one of the characters I recalled creating. It was great to RP a chance meeting (I was passing through the forest he lived in), to speak to this character that I had some vague understanding of. To dig through his character and back story. Out of nowhere he pulled out a map he wanted to show me, it had places I recognised from the world building I had done, it also had other places we hadn\u2019t created yet. I sat and explored that map with that particular character for a while. Learning about the places that I had never heard of before and how they linked to the areas I had previously mapped out with the AI.\n\nTo me that feels a little bit magical. Especially when at the end I can slip out of the RP scenario and tell the AI to summarise all that new information so we can update the world information and keep that new data, whether all of it or just the bits I liked.",
