    "body": "You are talking about being annoyed because you have exams and can not use AI to help you write your papers during exams. \n\nI am older than you-and we did not have chatgpt or anything like that around to help us write or bull shit papers or research and write. I had to just sit down and write for hours and look up stuff in a library or what we had on the internet at the time...before wikipedia was what it is today.\n\nSo I was saying- IT MUST BE NICE to have chat gpt to help since I had to do everything without AI  and basically analog which meant I had to waste hours of time to write papers and study for exams compared to writing a paper and studying now with the resources available.\n\nAsk chat gpt about writing papers in 1990 for college exams. It was a different time. We had to use dial-up to connect to the internet.",
