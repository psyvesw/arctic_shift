    "body": "Use it for coding and debugging. I always wanted to learn python. Never had the time to learn and really didn\u2019t know where to start. \n\nI understand that there\u2019s many free resources in YouTube. But to actually use chatgpt 4.0 specific to your application and challenges is such a game changer. \n\nI see posts here everyday that they don\u2019t find it useful. Here I am slowly automating many of the processes that used to be ver manual. As an example, vpm analysis. Shit took way too much time with the amount of data to do in excel. I know there\u2019s python libraries specific to vpm, but it\u2019s not specific to the logic I want it. So I ask chatgpt to go through a sample scenario and build it into a more complex set of panda code. \n\nNow it\u2019s just a direct feed from the sql source data and a click of a button in Jupyter to run the script to get the output. \n\nChatGPT is worth so much to me and has provided additional excitement in being able to learn and see what else I can do with it that I have always wanted to do\u2026 but really lacked the technical prowess. Sure I can ask a data engineer\u2026 but i don\u2019t want to waste their time. Yet here\u2019s this tool that has the patience of a monk and will work with you step by step without complaints.",
