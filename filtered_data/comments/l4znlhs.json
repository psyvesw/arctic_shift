    "body": "Gemini 1.0 Pro is terribly bad in today's standards - only slightly better GPT-3.5, though it has web access. It makes terrible errors at times and sometimes gets extremely confused with more challenging questions. Hope they'll update it to Gemini Flash 1.5 on the free web interface, at some point, since Flash already has a free API (15 free requests per minute).\n\nClaude Sonnet is okay, but has relatively restrictive limits.  \n  \nMicrosoft Copilot is okay, has web access, but is currently really slow (until it gets GPT-4o maybe).\n\nI haven't used perplexity in a while, so I don't know how got it currently is.\n\n**My recommendation:** (what I use as a baseline, before I go to GPT-4o): \n\nYou can freely use **Llama 3 70b instruct** on HuggingChat, without any apparent limits. It's very usable and competent (although tends to hallucinate slightly more than GPT-4o), and about as good as Claude Sonnet (depending on subject), but has a small 8k context size:\n\n[https://huggingface.co/chat](https://huggingface.co/chat)\n\nYou'll need to ensure you choose Llama 3 70b, and not the current default Command R+ model.",
