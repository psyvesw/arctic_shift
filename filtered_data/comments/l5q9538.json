    "body": "In future, maybe. It was analyzed in sf, I think, and it is a plausible scenario... just not with LLMs.\n\nRight now, LLMs are only next token predictors. They have NO agenda, they have NO planning skills, they can't learn from normal interactions.   \n\n\nThey get a long input and give as output a single token, something like \"The \", that's all. \n\nThen the program must concatenate the previous long input with the \"The \", create a new input, give it again to the LLM which replies with a new single token, like \"fact \". And so on.\n\nOr something on that line of work. I hope that makes clear how LLMs, right now and as long as the technology will still be that of the next token prediction, can't be supposed to have any secret plan. Anyway they, for sure, can TELL they have a secret plan, because they were trained on a lot of sf. :)",
