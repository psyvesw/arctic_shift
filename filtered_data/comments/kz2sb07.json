    "body": "You talk from non technological perspective and thats fine, but human beings can learn things in instance time from all senses, ChatGPT cannot do that it has been trained on a vast amount of data and its all essentially just vectors and maths that it uses, impressive definitely but you cant talk about it being smarter then humans when it is not actually taking in data in any other form then just images and text. \n\nIf you told ChatGPT that you learnt something new that it did not know, it would not learn that piece of information,  it would remember it in the context window but it wouldn't learn it and you can see that because if you close the window and ask about it it wont know it, now we cant call such a system intelligent, impressive definitely but not intelligent, imagine Einstein and you told him some proof and talked about it and were amazed by how good he was then the next day you asked again and he needed to understand all details again, you would be less impressed and now consider that Einstein could only understand al of this if you wrote him letters or showed him words that too with disruption and not continually. \n\nIts most likely true that OpenAI have got a model that can access real world data form other forms of input but the model we have access to is not that.",
