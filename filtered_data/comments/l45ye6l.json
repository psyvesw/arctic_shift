It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so confident when it gave the wrong answer. I'm not going to use something if I can't trust it or need to double-check the results all the time. They really need to teach AI to say \"I don't know\" more often.\n\nAlso, I don't like the idea of AI making decisions people really should. When AI does something really bad, no one will be able to explain why it did so.",
