    "body": "Those are good ideas, but I worry that the speed and fluency with which it spits out answers makes those answers seem better than they are. Especially to someone who doesn\u2019t know much about what they are asking about. Like did it actually tell you the best vacuum to buy, or did it just give you a convincing sounding paragraph about a vacuum that\u2019s probably fine?\n\nI was asking it about how I might go about building some web app and it suggested this framework that sounded really cool and easy! And it likely would have worked as advertised, but a cursory google search reveals that the framework is basically dead and doesn\u2019t support any kind of scale well. ChatGPT made it sound just as valid as industry standard frameworks. \n\nThis probably isn\u2019t a problem for simple, uncontroversial stuff like 8th grade algebra homework or the definition of promissory estoppel. But even for very benign things, I think people are too eager to take the computer\u2019s word for it when in reality it\u2019s about as reliable as the first Google result.",
