    "body": "I watched the GPT-4o presentations and was like: this is it. I work in education, and your personalized full time touter for everyone is here. The teacher/student duality is going to change. Everyone is now a student learning at different levels at their own paces, with AI, from AI.\n\nAfter months of anxiety eagerly anticipating the arrival of new multi-modal models, I have done some self reflection, I have realized that AI has indeed increased my productivity (and by a lot), but it has also drastically increasing my level of anxiety and sometimes mentally stopping me from starting new projects.\n\nInstead of starting a new project I would think \"maybe if I wait a month or so, new AI would do this automatically\" (one example would be creating the assets for my custom iOS app that I made for my students which involves a lot of text processing, audio segmentation and generating worksheets and practice questions related to such content. Yes I have used python scripts to automate as many of the steps as possible but when it comes to large contexts and accuracy and considering that I am working for myself by myself there is only so much I can do).\n\nSometimes it does feel painful and conflicting, but what a time to be alive.",
