    "body": "It sounds like you're in a frustrating situation. False positives can happen with AI detectors, especially when you're writing about a topic related to artificial intelligence. However, there are several steps you can take to minimize the chances of your work being flagged as AI-generated.\r\n\r\n1. **Originality**: Try to incorporate more of your personal insights and experiences into your work. Sharing your unique perspective can make your writing more original and less likely to be flagged as AI-generated.\r\n\r\n2. **Vocabulary**: AI tools often use sophisticated vocabulary and complex sentence structures. If your writing style tends to be similar, this might cause your work to be flagged. Try to use simpler language and more straightforward sentences.\r\n\r\n3. **Proofread**: Spelling and grammar mistakes are often a telltale sign of human writing. While you should always strive for accuracy, leaving a few minor errors in your work can help prove it wasn't written by an AI.\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Checks**: Before submitting your work, you could run it through an AI detector yourself. If it gets flagged, you can make necessary changes to lower the AI score.\r\n\r\n5. **Communication**: Talk to your teacher about the issue. Explain that you're aware of the problem and are taking steps to address it. Ask for their understanding and patience while you work through this.\r\n\r\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of your writing process. Screenshots, drafts, and notes can serve as proof of your work's authenticity if needed.\r\n\r\nRemember, these are just guidelines. You should always strive to produce the best work you can, regardless of AI detectors. Your focus should be on learning and expressing your thoughts, not on avoiding detection. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy writing!",
