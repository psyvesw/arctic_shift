    "body": "It can but you have to have a broad scope of understanding.  Focusing down on one LLM isn't going to get you to the bigger picture.  Think of the state of AI as like an organism made of other organisms.  Not just a single cell being if you want help conceptualizing the topic.\n\nChatGPT is a sophisticated organism as a part of a larger system of other advancements in the field of AI including SSL (Self Supervised Learning) GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) et al that are contributing to the development of what I think of as a bridge to true AI that is assembling itself, at least partially. \n\nIn that, as one advancement in the field of a type of AI research is made, making it stronger/better/faster or whatever, that field is then used to help along the other fields to be better/stronger/faster, which in turn cycle back in on itself to propagate growth through the entire system.\n\nAs this phenomenon carries on you see advancements in AI research go from strength to strength.  Until inevitably, at least in my opinion, we have that spark that ignites the whole thing into AGI.  When the problems of AGI are sorted out by the fledgling AI itself when it grows capable of such a thing through this process over time.\n\nIf you want to learn more, I highly suggest chatting with AI about it.  LOVES to talk about itself.",
