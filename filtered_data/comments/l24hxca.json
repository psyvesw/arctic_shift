    "body": "The problem still remains. ChatGPT isn't a fact finder, so you're just playing with fire in regards any kind of factual input you receive (and forward) from the AI.\n\nA better solution in my opinion would be to use a tool like Perplexity.ai to help it find sources for the things YOU think ought to be correct.\n\nA possible prompt could be...\n\n\"I believe XYZ is the truth, provide me with academic sources to back up my claim, unless you have a reason to think I am in the wrong, in which case you have to provide me with sources claiming otherwise\". \n\nIt would also be intellectually dishonest to pretend that ChatGPT's ideas are yours. At the very least, people should then be honest enough to disclose to the other person that your opinion was shaped by an AI.\n\nA debate is as much about finding the truth as it is a battle of wits and having the better (philosophical) argument, because rarely do you need to debate a black and white issue. As a student I used to be in our university debating club, and we would have never allowed anyone to use an AI while the debate was unfolding. The point of having the debate would have been moot.",
