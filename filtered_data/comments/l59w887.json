    "body": "Yeah it definitely works. I think what the LLMs does is avoid exact sentences and paragraphs contained in its training data or modifies said training data in the output. GPT-4 is pretty good at this. I haven\u2019t tried GPT-4o yet but I\u2019m sure it works the same way.\n\nI know this piece of shit is popular among teachers and professors since it\u2019s free: https://www.zerogpt.com/. All you need to do is use an AI service like ChatGPT and prompt it like so.\n\n\u201cPlease revise the following essay/paragraph to avoid AI detection software: (insert your writings (or AI writings lol) here)\u201d Then copy the output into ZeroGPT and see how it scores.\n\nYou could get really detailed and fancy with it like so: \u201cPlease revise the following essay/paragraph to avoid AI detection software and make it seem like it was written by a freshman in college:\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just an example but you can add as much detail and modifications to your prompt that you want!",
