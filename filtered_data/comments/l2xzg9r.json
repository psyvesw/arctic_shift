    "body": "I mean yea if you know what you are doing obviously you probably wont hit the cap unless you are using it a lot. Of course chatgpt is for everyone but I mean the people who the cap is the bad for them are those who actually dont know.\nIf you already know you need to count from 1 to 10 and all the other specific details as needed then yes you might make it in one or two promots but the whole limit is sucks for those who wants to get something but dont know how and have to start with a question like \"how you build a website?\" \"What is wordpress?\" \"What is html?\" \"Give basic html code\" \"now include button and a place to allow to insert text\". As you can see this is already 5 promots and i barely even started so imagine someone doing it also doesnt mean he will understand so he might ask it again differently.\nIm not taking it from you buddy, i guess chatgpt cap dont bother you because you could make those tasks yourself.",
