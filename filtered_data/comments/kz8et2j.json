    "body": "ChatGPT's answer here isn't really the answer you're looking for, but it's not wrong.  ChatGPT doesn't share the information you generate with it, of course--- you do, if you cheat.  If you take what ChatGPT produces and give it to your teachers that's on you, that's essentially what it's saying.\n\nThey won't necessarily \"know\" you used ChatGPT for schoolwork, but they can suspect it and sometimes that's enough. But someone *can* know if you use ChatGPT because ChatGPT has a very specific style and vocabulary. There are many phrases/words that it uses more than any others.  It is especially obvious if your teachers have previous things written by you and can compare what ChatGPT wrote with things you actually wrote.\n\nIf you want to use ChatGPT for *help* writing your essay, you'll have it produce what is essentially an outline that you can touch up and make better... or use it as a reference to write things in your own words.  \n\nBut if you just copy/paste what is coming from ChatGPT and submit it, it's very obvious to anyone who uses it just by looking at it.",
