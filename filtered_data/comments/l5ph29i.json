Right now it's a little bit Hit or Miss because of the hallucinations but even that can be mitigated. In the near future it won't be much better than that right out of the box and even in its current state it's ability to explain complex concepts in a way that is easy to grasp is literally unparalleled, anywhere (imo).\n\nTo be fair, a teacher would be able to explain a novel concept that is multifaceted and an AI probably could not until sufficient training data was available on the matter. But the vast majority of education is not that.",
