    "body": "soooooo true. i love AI and view it as a tool that has made me so much better at my job as a therapist because it helps me take my already abundant creativity and helps me learn how to channel that into a more clinical and professional way. like, as a side gig i lead therapy skills groups in a VR setting. i am someone who really struggles with structure and sticking to it. so if i give chatgpt a topic i wanna focus on and tell it to develop an outline for a therapy skills group on it, it teaches me what that looks like and how to apply it. and it has made the groups a lot smoother. but especially since im a therapist, it comes with a lot of \u201cam i even actually good at my job if i am using this to help me with ideas?\u201d which of course is a stupid way to think about it and the feedback i receive and the progress i see in my clients is proof im skilled at what i do. but it\u2019s exactly what you said. i feel like im \u201ccheating\u201d",
