    "body": "There is always the nuclear option.     \n    \nI have received your response on June 14th to my essay \"Hydrochloric acid - True or False?\".  \nI am somewhat concerned with your accusation that I have cheated and used artificial intelligence tools to write the essay.  This attitude offends me.     \n   \nThe simple fact is that artificial intelligence tools have not been used in writing the essay.    \n   \nI take the accusation or implication of cheating very seriously.    \nAs such any further mention of artificial intelligence tools being used by myself will be considered defamation and exposes both yourself and the school to legal liability under the Defamation Act 1992.    \n   \nIt is well known that artificial intelligence detection software has a bad reputation for generating false positives.   \nI will not have my good reputation tarnished by false accusations and lies because of faulty software.       \nI therefore advise you to reconsider your position.    \n   \nI give permission for you to share my essay with another competent teacher for their review before coming back to me with an appropriate grade.      \n   \nShould your position not have changed, I will have no choice but to seek legal advice,  involve the school board and The Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.",
