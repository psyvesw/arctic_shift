This is the sort of process you would employ with a person who is a digital artist. This was long before ChatGPT / DALLE existed and the image generation quality used to be terrible at the time. I tried creating a chatbot using ChatGPT and DALLE and while it is still not close to the final vision in terms of image consistency, it is still a lot better than the research we did years ago. Do try it out if you have some time!",
