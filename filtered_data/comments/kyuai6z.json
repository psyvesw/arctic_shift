    "body": "Ha!!! I actually agree with this as a tell in my students\u2019 essays. We went from zero use of the word \u201cdelve\u201d to a huge increase in sentences like, \u201dIn this book, Author X delves into the nuanced and fascinating issues of\u2026\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not proof of ChatGPT but a good indicator to slow down and start reading more carefully. Are all the paragraphs short? Was that the only sentence referencing our readings and the assignment instructions? Are there zero quotations or accurate summaries of the readings throughout? Does the essay take both sides of the argument instead of defending one side?\n\nWelp, doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s ChatGPT, does it, cause this pretty much hits all the non passing marks on my rubric! We can hold a meeting to discuss your F or you can meet with the Dean of Academic Dishonesty. \n\nI don\u2019t want to train the robots I want to teach humans how to develop their thinking skills.",
