    "body": "Free Version of what? The GPT? 1 week before there was no free version of GPT4.  \nAnd I can name you 10 Applications with integrated AI without the option of free versions - and, as I said, these are all \"wrappers\" - they do nothing you could not do in GPT with clever prompting.\n\nTo use the api you need to know how. Not a good idea for someone who aren't working in tech or have done a few similar things in tech already.\n\nAnd if you wanna pay $20 per month - do it.\n\nYou should read the definition of words before using them - I do not promise or advertise functionality that my product do not have.\n\nI said the product is primary for students their universities blocked ChatGPT in their networks - such a dumbass like you isn't a student so keep quite.",
