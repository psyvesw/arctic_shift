    "body": "I'm gonna be honest, nobody has gaslit me as much as GPT has, but I am still coming back for more, haha. Thank you for saying that! \ud83e\udd70 It's still frowned upon in my community when people find out one uses AI to aid them in school or to sound smarter or better than they actually do in person, but rest assured that's not my intention. I was diagnosed with ADHD and struggle to keep up with conversations and stay on topic. GPT has really aided me and taught me how to communicate better in English. My mother language is Tagalog, and despite having English in our curriculum, composing it is a challenge for me because people often misinterpret what I say.\n\nI\u2019ll DM the Google Drive folder containing the PowerPoint files. It's quite a lot, so if it's better for you, you can start with just one and show me how to do it or provide a link to a tutorial I can follow. \ud83d\ude42\u00a0\n\nFor the generated flashcards, I was hoping that they would follow a format similar to this example:\n\n\n\nFRONT OF CARD: Health History\n\n\n\n\n\nBACK OF CARD:\u00a0\n\n\n\n{{\n\n* Review the patient's PAST MEDICAL HISTORY (PMH), including:\n   * Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)\n   * Hypertension (HTN)\n   * Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)\n   * Stroke\n   * Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)\n* Childhood diseases\n* Past hospitalizations and major illnesses\n* Current health history: symptoms and chief complaint\n* Medications\n* FAMILY HISTORY:\n   * CAD\n   * HTN\n   * RHD\n   * Stroke\n   * CHF\n* Psychosocial history }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure how to word it for the prompt, but what overwhelmed me about the original pptx is\u00a0 that it's lengthy, redundant, lacks clarity in some areas, overall just a bunch of disorganized informations.\n\n\n\nI told GPT that It can paraphrase, shorten sentences but I sometimes catch it removing really important key points.\n\n\n\nI then asked it to just reorganize while keeping all the informations the same; it ended up rewriting the whole thing word for word [\ud83d\ude02](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy)\n\n\n\nThank you again for your willingness to help I really appreciate it!",
