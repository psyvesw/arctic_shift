    "body": "Brilliant comment my friend, enjoyed reading this and will probably be sharing with friends.\n\nHeres the thing tho... I think you're wrong about there being a laborer class in the world you're describing, because there would be no one to labor for without UBI. I mean, sure there would be big corps and the ultra rich, but they're not able to provide enough labor for all the people who normally... say... did accounting.\n\nHowever, I think we'll have a long time until companies trust AI enough to outsource their labor to it. Like, 10-20 years until the current generation growing up with AI gets in positions of power. Maybe even longer.",
