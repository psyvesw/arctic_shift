    "body": "ChatGPT as it is, knows a LOT of facts, but there are always going to be gaps in it's knowledge when tested on niche subjects and fine details. Being so good at language, like us, it makes up some details to fill in the blanks and makes it sound legit.  \nFor use as a reliable tool as a teacher, or museum tour guide, or any other location where finer details need to be correct, then the base model, even though it's good, is not fit for purpose.  For use in those applications the school system,  museum etc need models trained on their specific topic. Again like us, with extra training in a specific field it can become an expert, and more trustworthy source of information. \nI think that the OP's enthusiasm for the future is justified, we just need to keep in mind that the public facing Jack of All trades ChatGPT that we get to play with is only a (very good) base model, and can never compete with a trained expert model in a given area.",
