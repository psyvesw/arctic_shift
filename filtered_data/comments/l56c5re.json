    "body": "I use it all the time for personal and work (I\u2019m a UX Designer):\n\n- Writing code when I need to create UI interactions and am too lazy to look up the correct format. Also helpful for making plugins for other apps (Figma)\n- Generating project briefs with OKRs, user journeys, clarifying problem statements, etc. \n- Writing copy for UI because our team doesn\u2019t have a content writer\n- Creating performance reviews\n- Starting travel research for personal travels. This has saved a ton of time as I can ask to create an itinerary based on my preferences. Also great for finding specific flight routes from major airlines. \n- General search: I no longer Google things and just ask it directly. It\u2019s faster and saves me a lot of time/energy. Recently used this to find out why my jaw was popping after committing (stress). \n- Movie suggestions. Give it a list of movies you like and explain why you like them, gives great suggestions. \n- Creating prompts for other Gen AI tools like Midjourney\n\nI use it multiple times a day and do quite a bit of prompt engineering to get better results. Also a paid user.",
