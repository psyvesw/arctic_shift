    "body": "I\u2019ve been looking into this for about\u202612 hours (not constantly of course). I can see exactly why it looks *not natural* - That\u2019s the part that I\u2019m working on\u2026it seems clear that the image has been modified further than normal processing using jpeg compression and so forth. My initial opinion is that the Image was an original photograph; HOLD FIRE!!\u2026I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s unedited though. Here we must differentiate between \u2018real\u2019 which I\u2019ll call a \u2018photo\u2019, \u2018CGI\u2019, \u2018Edited\u2019 and AGI. Currently I\u2019m of the belief that the image has absolutely been edited beyond the original photo, I suspect that edited has been conducted using tools like photoshop or AI. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been generated from scratch\u2026I think it\u2019s been modified using AI image manipulation. These do show-up under image analysis in different ways. Different methods show very different indicators. My curiosity is actually WHICH method was used. I happened to have been working on my own AI Model to analyse an image to determine location indicators, asses human and animal activities and many more things. If anyone is interested then please let me know and maybe you guys and gals can throw some photos at me in a separate thread (no private info included) that YOU KNOW the location of (not your own road ideally) and I will test the model to see what it can do. I\u2019ve put rather a lot of effort into it, it performs various analyses on the image (never using metadata btw lol) and has very much surprised me on multiple occasions. I\u2019ve gone as far as Sun vs Shadow length analysis combined with weather conditions searched live and much, much more. \n\nANYWAY, I\u2019ll upload some of the basic image analysis that I carried out on this topic. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the tool I made (regardless of originality of the image) says the following about the image (it\u2019s not attempting to validate or verify just to be clear) \n\n*Output Summary from my Tracker tool:*\n\nBased on these observations, here is a probable description:\n\nProbable Location:\nThe image likely depicts a scene from a temperate, mountainous region with lush vegetation, such as the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. Specifically, areas like North Carolina or Tennessee, which have similar landscapes, modern recreational infrastructure, and a mix of deciduous and coniferous forests, fit the characteristics seen in the image.\n\nProbable Time:\nThe time of the day is likely late morning to early afternoon, given the position of shadows and the lighting.\n\nProbable Climate:\nThe climate appears to be temperate with moderate seasonal variations, supported by the type of vegetation and cloud patterns.",
