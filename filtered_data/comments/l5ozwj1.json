    "body": "I think it's funny white collar and tech have spent the last 20 years telling the trades and blue collar that automation is coming and to learn to code or be ruined, but now the script is flipped and white collar people have created a monster that will run them out of a job first because all it takes to replace the maybe 8 productive hours they have in a week is some scripting an ai can spit out in seconds. The white collar workforce is wildly overbloated with inefficient people because the barrier to entry is easier, especially when the work doesn't require stem education or skills ( middle management, business, hr). Companies will be better off once that fat is trimmed and the world will continue to spin as they adapt by aquiring worthwhile skills.",
