If someone\u2019s asking \u201cso what\u2019s the most important thing about the next model\u201d and expecting a different answer than \u201cI\u2019m sorry did you not hear me?  it\u2019s smarter janice, of course there the most important thing, what part of this whole AI thing just isn\u2019t making sense to you\u201d then maybe they just need a reminder.\n\nEverything else we\u2019re doing with AI, generating pictures and music and video, the backrooms, websim, those are all adorable little tourist stops off the highway; but the highway leads to superintelligence, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing all this.  Everything that isn\u2019t \u201cthe next one is smarter\u201d is ultimately a fun distraction.  Multimodal?  Whatever.  Longer context?  Wow, sure.  Memory?  Okay.  But *smarter*?  Go back to using GPT-3.5 for a day if you\u2019ve forgotten what that was like.\n\n(Also, my first response was a joke.  I meant all of the words in it, they\u2019re all true, but that wasn\u2019t the *point*.)",
