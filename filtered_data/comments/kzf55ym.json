What are you even replying to?\n\n>We need to learn a lesson from what happened to the internet? What the actual fuck are you talking about?\n\nI will elaborate. When the internet was just starting out it was very different. It was a shiny new tech which had a lot of potential, it changed commerce, communications and the way we access information. However, a few companies like Facebook made a lot of money off of antagonizing people, promoting disinformation and creating awful echo chambers to the point where it adversely impacts society as a whole. This is the lesson we need to learn: shiny new tech is cool but we have an obligation to steer it in the right direction, or we are all going to suffer for it.\n\n\n>I\u2019m 50/50 on whether it was written by an LLM\n\nToo late to tell by now \ud83d\ude42",
