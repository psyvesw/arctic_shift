    "body": "AI models (like LLMs, ChatGPT, etc.) are not perfect. And they're less perfect when they can only answer from a specific knowledge source, e.g. NYC's business/tax laws.  \n  \nBut the only way an organisation can learn how to leverage AI is to just start using it. Add the caveats, acknowledge the risks, but launch something.  \n  \nNYC is now miles ahead of other states/cities in leveraging AI to help their citizens access complicated laws & rules more easily.  \n  \nOf course, the media is going to pounce on some problematic replies. But what % of its replies were wrong or misleading?  \n  \nIf it's only 5%, then I'd argue that's totally acceptable, given the benefit to people using it.  \n  \nAnd, what's the alternative? No AI chatbot?  \n  \nThat means citizens and business owners are navigating through the vast web of regulations and laws and trying to figure out answers for themselves.  \n  \nWill they always come to the correct conclusion? Definitely not.  \n  \nSo the real question is, will an AI chatbot help more people get the right answer?  \n  \nI think, yes.",
