    "body": "I understand. My wording is confusing indeed. I use it to get \u00ab\u00a0information I\u2019m looking for\u00a0\u00bb, which is usually something I\u2019m knowledgeable about to a certain degree. For instance, let\u2019s say I want to know something about a prefecture in Japan that I\u2019ve never been to. GPT will provide pure information that I CAN\u2019T vet. In that case I will rather use Google in the first place, instead of using GPT as the base and do all the vetting research work anyway.\n\nNow, if the information I\u2019m looking for is the name for that cylindric pot you put your cutlery in when washing dishes so they can dry vertically, then I will ask GPT, because I know it\u2019s a better tool to get what I want based on a definition. That\u2019s still information, but that\u2019s not something that would take me much time to vet, because when GPT gives me the name of the thing, I do an Image Google search and immediately see if the answer is relevant or not.\n\nA funny example would be when I asked GPT for the lyrics of RATM \u00ab\u00a0Bulls on parade\u00a0\u00bb and an interpretation of those lyrics : the first verse was missing (!) and the interpretation was off. That\u2019s not the kind of task GPT 3.5 is up to, and it\u2019s faster to Google search that.",
