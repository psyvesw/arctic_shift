    "body": "We\u2019re still in the early days of generative AI. I do side work online training these models (dataannotation.tech, if anyone is looking for extra cash), and there are some models that are built like apps where the prompt and response is one step in the process of giving output, and the models will iterate over and over until they have a final product.\u00a0\n\nThey will take your prompt and use it to write instructions to itself, generate a response to those instructions, analyze its own output, compare to your prompt, and repeat until it is satisfied. Think of when you have 5 conversion turns to fine tune a response, and imagine the model corrected itself 5 times instead of you having to do it.\u00a0\n\nRunning a model in this way all but ensures that every instruction you give is adhered to.\u00a0",
