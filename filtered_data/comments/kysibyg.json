    "body": "A lot of people struggle with identifying content which is very obviously AI-generated, and I think the reasons why are interesting.  \n\nWith images, I've noticed that people who tend to be really flummoxed by AI art tend to themselves have no background in the visual arts. To someone who thinks about images in terms of drawing fundamental shapes, or photographs in terms of lens focus, AI gaffes immediately draw the eye. But most people havent developed these neural pathways. They're not automatically thinking about how they would have lit a photo or solved a tricky perspective issue.  \n\nSimilarly with generated text, I've noticed that people who think GPT4 is a good writer tend to themselves struggle with English composition or communication in general.  GPT4's default writing style has a very noticeable voice. It sounds like an 18 year old valedictorian writing a college admissions essay.  It's too earnest, too florid, and uses way too many unnecessary words from the SAT vocabulary list.  To someone who doesnt write well, GPT4's suggested rephrasing of an email always sounds great.  To someone who does, GPT4 tends to read like if Russel Brand wrote an HR manual.",
