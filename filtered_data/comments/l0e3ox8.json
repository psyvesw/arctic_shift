    "body": "This pisses me off so much! I have actually had professors say to the class that they can tell when someone is using AI because they use 'fancy' words \"nobody actually talks like that! It's AI!\" Well, I am autistic and I have always written formally. My mom said I sounded like a professor when I first started talking because of how proper I was. It pisses me off that I have to fear using big words in college!? Like WTF! Isn't that the point of going to college? To use bigger and better words!? What the actual fuck. I'm sorry but this AI situation is being taken to the extreme by college professors who don't understand the technology and some of them are constantly in AI witch hunt mode now! They've been convinced that nearly every student is trying to cheat with AI. It's so fucking confounding. It's like you are fucked if you do, fucked if you don't. I have actually dumbed down my language in college papers because of this with certain professors and it PISSES ME OFF! (Did I say that yet?)\n\nThis is the antithesis of higher education! It is diametrically opposed to my improvement as a person. Please end this anti-AI crusade and learn to be a real professor! Or would that take actually getting to know your students and their capabilities?\n\nARGLEBARGLESCHNARGLEFARGLE!!!!!!!!!",
