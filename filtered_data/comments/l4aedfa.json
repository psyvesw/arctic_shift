    "body": ">How? Expand this point please. Are you suggesting that you could take a free course and then compete against someone who paid for a degree? Because we have guardrails against that too, that's the entire point of why you need to prove your credentials and where you got them from. A degree in Math is not the same as a free course in math, nor could you ever attempt to pretend it is because academia has always been rigorous against this. \n\nYou absolutely could, the first person to come to mind is Michael Reeves. Especially in the field of computer science you can get a job as long as you can prove your competency. You're right that there are some guardrails against this depending on the industry, but do you think those guardrails are justified? Why would you prevent a more competent person from occupying a position just because they didn't have the money to pay for the more expensive certificate?\n\n>I think you're argument rests on your opinion that AI produces original works and I don't think it does. It's an algorithm, it literally has no judgement it's just spitting out stuff procedurally.\n\nThe human brain is no different, however you define judgement it either applies to both or neither.\n\n>That's why hallucinations are such a problem,\n\nHallucinations ARE creativity. You don't make an idea happen in your brain, it happens to you.\n\n>where there are millions of sources saying Elon musk is alive and yet the AI spits out that he's dead. That's unusable in my opinion. A pitiful result for something that ate so much data without permission and is desperate for even more. \n\nCould you cite where you saw this?",
