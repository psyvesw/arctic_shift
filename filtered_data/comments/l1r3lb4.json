    "body": "Yes, I like your comment, you at least tried to think about it and say reasonable things: it\u2019s been a while but I wanted to be sure you knew that I appreciated what you said. The AI tool had more visitors in less time than any other internet phenomenon ever. They are making something that will not be optional to use in the future if you want to be competitive. They are making the future of culture and all the other AI major platforms are following suit. The Nazis didn\u2019t really have as much relentless power and potential to change culture as that. So they should be criticized. I do not care if it is a private corporation polluting a river or Nazis burning a book. If a private company does something that threatens to unleash the worst impulses of humanity, why would I act differently? Thats no reason not to care. Pornography is nothing by comparison. Other than that private company comment I liked what you said. They are making future culture. Any politician knows that initial spin on anything new is extremely important even in comparatively trivial matters. There\u2019s an ecology of freedom that needs careful reverence to survive. Ai is by far the biggest danger freedom has ever faced. There\u2019s no place to immigrate to anymore. Were it. It\u2019s important AF. The central issue as far as I\u2019m concerned. I studied human behavior and evolutionary psychology for 4 years in the PhD program at Emory University.",
