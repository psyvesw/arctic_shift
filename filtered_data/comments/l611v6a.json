    "body": "Yeah I remember this popping up on /r/programming the other day and people shitting using these models for stuff. Queue tons of comments about how \"I use ChatGPT and it spits out horrible code every time, it's useless.\"\n\nI don't know how people are using these tools to get such bad results, but I'm a software developer and I use GPT4/4o all the time. I use it for stuff it's good at, namely\n\n- Handling tedious code. eg \"Convert X code to Y code\". \"Take this switch and break it out into functions\", \"Take this model class and make it implement ObservableObject/ObservableProperty\", etc\n\n- Feeding it a task and then iterating on the results to come up with ideas for an implementation. I've used this to come up with a DB layer implementation in C++ for an old MMO I work on as a hobby. I'll get some ideas based on what it spits out, do some research if needed, and implement something on my own from there. I found out about std::variant through an answer it gave in this example, which I ended up doing more research on and using.\n\nObviously people shouldn't just copy/paste whatever is shit out from the prompt. But I have a feeling a lot of people don't understand how to use these tools.\n\nI have a feeling developers getting poor results are either trying to make it do something really niche, using old models, or just don't know what or how to ask it things.",
