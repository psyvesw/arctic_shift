    "body": "Because if I don't and I explain why it is obviously wrong I don't want a response back like \"I understand why you might be confused! \"  . Or if I ask to make test case and it fails I want it to look at why they fucked up the test. And not  blaming a logical mistake in my functions. \n\nI made python regarding studying Turkish flashcards and it thinks it understands Turkish grammar but it is ALWAYS wrong.
