    "body": "This, though. Every AI generated text I've ever seen is painfully, obviously AI. Unless it's completely innocuous and vapid, and you wouldn't be able to tell either way. Not only is it often wrong, or very nearly gibberish, you can just sense from the syntax, how the AI has strung words together, that no human writes this way. You can, without even trying, see the way some algorithm is slapping information together in a strictly mathematical way. \n\nEveryone who espouses AI use basically just use it as a form of Google. Google itself tries to gurgle nonsensical AI smut at you. I just don't get it. It's as if to these folks we haven't had the ability to find things out on the internet for a very good chunk of time. It's a strict downgrade, where now you have to sit there and chew the cud, so to speak, to glean any real knowledge from an algorithmic sprawl. And even then, often that algorithm has interspersed blatant misinformation or complete nonsense into the actual information. So you still have to do further research, leaving one wondering what's even the point in the first place.",
