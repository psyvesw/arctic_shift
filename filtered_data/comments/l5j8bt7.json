    "body": "the ones where someone has to go to jail for gross negligence.\nhow do you enforce responsibility on a machine, or the ones creating the machine?\nif you try to make companies or CEOs liable for what AI does, we won't see AI in anything of importance for a long time. No one will want to be responsible for a black box that may decide that running over a bunch of kids is a better choice than crashing into a tree endangering the owner - or vice versa. imagine the lawsuits and the engineers trying to explain in court why they deemed their algirithms reasonably safe to let out into the world by the millions.\n\n\nin the meantime, AI will completely take over art, music, literature - you know, stuff where mistakes don't lead to lawsuits.\n\n\nif you have a job where you can fail and not get sued, you're going to get replaced. unless, of course, hiring you is cheaper than renting a robot - because most of what it cost to make and rause you to the point at which you can sell your labor was financed by your parents. it's external costs, from a business standpoint. robots might be too expensive for a business for a while, as those costs will not be shouldered by your parents.",
