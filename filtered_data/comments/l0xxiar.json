    "body": "Honestly, I don't know, but here are a couple of things you can try:\n\nIf your professor has office hours, go to them and talk about the issue. Explain how you are testing your writing against AI detectors, and what you are having to do in order to avoid the false positive. If they listen, this could give them evidence that the tool doesn't work, but it could also mark you as a student who is earnestly trying to do good work.\n\n  \nRequest (either via email or office hours) information on how they validated the tool. Chances are, they haven't, and maybe the line of questioning can push them in that direction. If they have, and they are willing to explain how they did so, then the information they provide could help you suggest different ways to test the software to expose its inadequacies.\n\nBoth of these exceptions assume that a) your professor has the patients and willingness to work with you and b) that the software is baloney. 'a' can depend on your university and the professor, but I am fairly confident in 'b'.",
