No they could absolutely not have released it \"weeks ago\" because it's still several weeks away from release, there is a lot of functionality that was demoed but which still isn't ready for release.\n\n>Most AI doesn't have a specific moment when it's due to release, you can keep training it.\n\nWhat is a \"most AI\"? You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about here. Of course it is being continuously trained, what kind of imbecile would think that all AI companies have suddenly stopped training models!? That doesn't mean that they release a new model every day, training isn't what makes a new model. \n\nDude you clearly literally don't have the slightest clue about any of this at all and all you wanted to do was whine about getting more and more stuff.
