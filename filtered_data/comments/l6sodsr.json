    "body": "Chat GPT is an incredible feat. Using neural networks and deep learning AI technologies are able to harness vast amounts of data and transform it, which is similar to how the human brain works, but with even more access to information. \n\nThere are serious ethical implications about having this technology available and in that regard you are correct that it is amazing and also scary. \n\nOn the flip side, AI as we have it is still imperfect, based on algorithms and Bayesian statistics. It makes inferences based on what\u2019s available, so it\u2019s unlikely to come up with something new or novel on its own. While there is an \u201cintelligence\u201d there it\u2019s not an autonomous cognisance. In addition, it often cites fake references in text or fills in the gaps with things that are not quite true, so it is prone to error. \n\nWe have a long way to go and I\u2019m nervous about it. I recommend you look into the works of mark coeckelberg to learn more.",
