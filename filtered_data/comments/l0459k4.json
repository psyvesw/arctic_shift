    "body": "Excellent use of the tool. Somewhat relevant (although yours is definitely more serious and I don\u2019t want to compare), I studied aeronautical engineering for my undergrad after military service. While I work in Aviation now, I\u2019ve always been drawn to CompSci, and now subsequently AI. I decided to pursue a Masters in AI/ML and am completely out of my element.\n\nNow getting to the relevant part, the course is full of hours and hours of reading, YouTube lectures, and interactive textbooks. After learning what I\u2019ve learned, I go into Python and try to type it out. Having never touched Python previously, I keep getting Syntax and other types of errors. So instead of having ChatHPT just solve it for me and learn nothing, I give it a prompt to essentially lecture me on what I\u2019m doing wrong, provide insight, etc. Not only does it do a perfect job of explaining where I went wrong and what to look out for, it also shows correct solutions. An incredible versatile tool, but if you use it right, it\u2019s like having a professor right at your desk. One-on-one time with an expert. And in your case, one-on-one with a medical professional who won\u2019t huff and puff and charge you hundreds in co-pays.\n\nI\u2019m glad it spelled it out for you in a way that doesn\u2019t take an expensive medical professional to explain it in complicated terms. Best of luck to you and your father",
