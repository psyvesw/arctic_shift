    "body": "So perhaps you can clear something up for the masses. Im an enthusiast, but was not curently paying for Chat GPT plus. Amazed by the demo, we all ran and upgraded our plans, which is where we found voice mode via the headphone symbol. I, like most people who just upgraded, believed this to be the brand new real time voice feature. There is a delay but its actually pretty fast, so I think we all assumed. \n\nI cant seem to find a good explanation on this. Is it just poor communication or intentionally misleading? Can you clairfy if my assessment is correct on why there is confusion?\n\nI will say the premise that we havent even seen the new voice model yet makes me happy as I was having some disappointing results with the current one. The idea of a much more powerful conversational feature is coming outshines the nontroversary of losing Sky. Although, I am team revive Sky.",
