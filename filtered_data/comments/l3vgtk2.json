    "body": "My gut reaction is using AI in an editorial way like this is fine.\n\nBut lets consider the other side in good faith to be sure. Here's a thought experiment: a school has made it mandatory to run work through AI before handing in for proof reading and editing. Students are complaining their work is no longer their voice. What might their argument be?\n\n1. Students may feel that the use of AI homogenizes their writing, making it sound similar to everyone else's who uses the same AI tools and loses individuality. AI's suggestions could overlook nuances or cultural references that are important to their writing.\n2. Relying too heavily on AI could lead to a decreased ability to self-edit and improve their writing independently. Repeated corrections could negatively impact students' confidence potentially discouraging them from expressing themselves freely in their writing. After homogenization they cannot remember how they used to write and start to worry they cannot even prompt with individuality anymore.",
