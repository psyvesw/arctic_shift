    "body": "It seems like how much weight a GPT puts on elements of the total dataset upload (eg. a subject) depends heavily on what percentage of the total words are on that element/subject. Eg. You can have a 10k word file with 10 subjects, and another 10k word file explaining 1 subject, and if you add both in, the responses will be super-heavily based on the second file. Even if you repeatedly and strictly advise it in the instructions not to do so. \n\nThis is particularly dangerous for research and analysis work, where it's not developing the answers based on information like it rationally should, but rather is biased by sheer weight in terms of information volume.\n\nI hope OpenAI has a way to fix this, as I'm sure many businesses will end up making bad decisions/having bad takeaways based on this.",
