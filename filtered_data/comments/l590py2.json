    "body": "With gpt4o, I am now creating a simple web browser extension. It's a simple note-taking extension. I've only coded in Python and briefly in C before, never html or js. Before starting it with Ai, I had no idea even how you began making an extension. Now I have a working setup that functions but needs improvements to look nice.\n\n I'm a visual learner, so being able to watch AI change the code between requests is a massive boost to learning. I'm already able to make alterations on my own and have gtp print only portions of code to help rather than rewright entire code each request. \n\nIt's much better than stack overflow where you would have had to post a question, wait 30 minutes, and maybe get an answer if someone was kind enough.\n\nThe only downside is the gpt limited useage. It's really annoying when you're making progress and run out of tokens. uI would pay, but apparently, you just get more requests, not unlimited usage, so I just use it as an opportunity to take a break or push myself to learn more.",
