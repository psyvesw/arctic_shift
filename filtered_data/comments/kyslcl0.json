    "body": "ChatGPT is a great resource for finding other resources or asking a quick rundown on the dumb / specifically curious questions that something like a keyword search engine like google can't find a tailored website for. You should absolutely not use it as a substitute to understand the topic at hand for you. At that point you will learn nothing and you will stir crap the second anyone asks you to apply your supposed knowledge in the field, on the fly.\n\nYes, I know you prompted it to sound like an english second learner, but (ironically enough) from someone who *has* taken, but didn't necessarily major in many years of environmental science; It is written like a 7th grader. Not grammar wise, but in structure. I know my english isn't great either. Is that necessarily bad? No. Though by looking at *just* the essay text, anyone worth their salt could smell blood in the water.\n\nEspecially for a *college degree* I would instead use the individual talking points to expand into a more comprehensive and fluid paper. Then you could actually learn *something* as you go.",
