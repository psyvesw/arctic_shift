    "body": "Sure. \n\nI work in sales, I use it to polish marketing material, organize list, and bounce ideas off for lead generation\u2014with decent success. I had it justify which products to focus on, much like I use my mentor in business for\u2014  but probably better. \n\nMy hobby is CNC, 3d printing, just general tinkering. I use the image generation and convert them to SVG\u2019s then make/cut/engrave\u2014usually I give little gifts to my clients but the designs are way above my drawing ability. \n\nI\u2019m a lot better with microcontrollers and Python, like I\u2019m probably good enough to get a job in IT. I had taken AP comp science 15 years ago, but I mean I can actually code thanks to GPT, and that came with maxing out inquiries night after night. \n\nI use image generation to make coloring book pages for my daughter, and then worksheets to compliment her classroom \u2014she\u2019s way ahead in math so spelling sheets and stories for her to read that throw her into a super Mario or Minecraft story. \n\nI use the voice feature in my car everyday. It\u2019s just random: from physics concepts, to history, I have it pull world news, I argue with it over the meaning of life, I mean it\u2019s like having a smart friend that only wants to listen. I ask a very wide range of topics. \n\nLastly I\u2019ve used it in self help soft of. Like as it remembers the chats I\u2019ll ask it to find inconsistencies or challenge my perspective. It\u2019s awesome as a self growth tool, I haven\u2019t gotten overly personal with it, but it\u2019s really helped me cut some distractions in my work life that have no doubt made me more money. \n\nI could go on but I think it paints a decent picture. It would be fantastic for an engineer; so much material science data. \n\nFor me, it\u2019s made me more money than it cost because it\u2019s made it easier for me to help my clients.",
