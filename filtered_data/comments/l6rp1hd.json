    "body": "I\u2019d say OpenAI\u2019s GPT4o and Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus. The issue isn\u2019t so much which one (though of course flagship ones will tend to perform better), but the fact that none are *expressly* designed for summarizing alone. LLMs tend to follow a \u201cpath\u201d of where they believe the text is going\u2014and the longer the text is, the more they\u2019ll stray from where it actually goes (or starts with). Sure, the rest of the text will *theoretically* keep it on track, but only to a point. To give you a (perhaps poor) simile, it\u2019s like a rather creative person who\u2019s asked to paraphrase a text: the longer it goes on, the more the person will be tempted to insert some of its own ideas.\n\nThe trick is to divide it in chunks and ask the AI to process them one at a time, since then each new chunk \u201cresets\u201d the AI\u2019s thinking to whatever that segment leads with.\n\nThe problem is that ChatGPT Plus isn\u2019t designed to do this\u2014and neither is Anthropic\u2019s Claude Pro, for that matter. By and large, you\u2019d have to use external automated tools (that would then rely on the AI\u2019s API service, which is a different one you have to pay for separately) to automatically divide the entire document into more manageable chunks, summarize each one (perhaps in the same \u201cconversation\u201d, but still different prompts), then combine the results.\n\nI don\u2019t know any, sorry\u2014there\u2019s probably quite a few, I just don\u2019t know any because I haven\u2019t tried them\u2014but, if you don\u2019t want to go for extra (paid) services just for that, you could try doing it yourself, with ChatGPT. I grant you it might be a hassle, especially if you have to divide the document a lot to ensure faithfulness to the original\u2026 but if it helps, you can always temporarily set Custom Instructions to the effect that *\u201cEverything I input, consider it a fragment of text I want you to summarize, outputting nothing else but the summary itself\u201d*, to at least simplify the task a bit.",
