    "body": "Well she's voice acting as well so in some instances it sounds like her. But I suppose the problem is exactly this. People can't tell the difference. It makes it way easier to run scams and slap her voice and face on it.\n\nI mean do a stable diffusion video with that voice while looking like it was shot on a non-professional camera. Then it's pretty convincing given microphone distortion.\n\nOf course once you point it out it's clear as day, but I have seen people fall for obvious AI content thinking it was real and I know for sure that I have as well given how good it's gotten. It's alarming really so I can understand people with more than enough content online to create then as full carbon copy.\n\nGreat times but dangerous as well given its getting harder to verify what's real and not and we're likely already falling for stuff we didn't realize",
