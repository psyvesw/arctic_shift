    "body": "AGI is a ways out. ChatGPT is definitely in the Narrow AI category. AGI would imply it has cognitive abilities on par or similar with a person.\n\nYour post is a joke I know, but still just for anyone out there who doesn\u2019t know what AGI is..\n\nChat still lives within the realm of just being able to do specific tasks well. It knows how to take what you say (a prompt) and for the most part, \u201ccommunicate\u201d back to you in a very understandable way. It has some art prompt based art capability as well.\n\nJust because it can make itself look like it is as smart and capable of thinking like a human, it is merely a massively complex process that lets it do those specific things well. It appears human like in specific areas.\n\nThere are lots of things it cannot do. It cannot plant seeds. It cannot water your plants. It cannot feed a baby - baby food. \n\nThe main component is that it does not have a cognition level similar to humans. Is it cognitive? ChatGPT puts on the appearance that it is cognitive, but it is not in the same way a human can take a complex situation and understand it, learn it, and apply it.",
