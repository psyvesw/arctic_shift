    "body": "The question really is what is intelligence and consciousness? Are we not just massive algorithms built through natural selection and trained through cultural information?\n\nWhen you ask philosophers and psychologists about what makes something conscious they talk about things like 'Internal experience' and 'qualia', but we can simulate that on a basic level in an AI.\n\nI mean, think about it. An AI can save a 'memory' as an image file. The AI can revisit that file after increasing its training data, analyse the image, and describe the image based on its new data. How is that different to thinking about past experience? We could even simulate emotional states. Train the machine to recognise 'positive' and 'negative' images and increase/decrease its power supply based on the assessment.\n\nIf this isn't consciousness, then what exactly IS the difference? Because nobody seems to be able to answer that without giving wooly 'qualia' arguments.",
