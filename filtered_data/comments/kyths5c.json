    "body": "That\u2019s because it is AI. Too many times people glance and automatically assume real. Just look at the picture and break it down. First off that gutter system is atrocious for moving water. All lights are on in the house and for some reason they implemented a fire torch right on the log cabin.. the chimney morphs into the roof itself and doesn\u2019t show natural build around the pan the tomatoes are in seems to be underneath the pan of meat of melding in to it. Beer labels are different and just lines for writing. Idk what the hell it was trying to add on the table behind the meat, maybe a garnish but that\u2019s the most awkward thing there.  Plus the tree in the water. Is that a reflection? If so, why does it not match at all the tree above it? \n\nWe have to learn to look before we act. Think before we accept.",
