    "body": "Like it or not, experience is how AIs are trained. It needs trial and error to progress and while it's better equipped to do that incertain fields, it's also it's weakness in other.\n\nAI music didn't teach us that AI doesn't need people, quite the opposite. It was trained on our music and is good at making boilerplate filler based on it, just like it did with text. It's not a surprise, we already knew that.\n\nThe question isn't, can it make stuff but can it make something new and good on its own?",
