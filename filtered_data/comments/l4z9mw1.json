    "body": "My question is:  Is there a legal argument to be made?  \n\nScarJo doesn't have a unique sounding voice. There are celebrities out there who I think could argue when company is using their likeness (voice) without permission. Think of like Christopher Walken, William Shatner, Morgan Freeman. \n\nWhen you imitate those voices there is no room for ambiguity. No one else really sounds like them. Half the women in my life sound like Scarlett Johansson. She has the lowest common denominator voice. She has a nice voice, she is an actor so legally her likeness and performance are copyrighted. But to what degree can a non descript voice be copywritten?\n\nObviously the fact that OpenAI was trying to work with her to use her voice will give her ammunition in court.  But if it's argued they changed it 15% from what a copy would be.  What if it's 30%.  \n\nWhat does the law say?  Because to me, that's an interesting angle.",
