    "body": "I'm wondering if it has to do with the usual color coding in tv and film (and their corresponding posters/merch images). It seems as though Hollywood has deemed blue/white the \"benevolent\" color for technology (and sometimes just neutral). Red and purple usually appear when the tech is supposedly malfunctioning or somehow \"evil\". Green/orange were relegated to \"old-school\" tech like in Fallout or when referring to the old DOS systems from the 80s in film. I've seen yellow used for representing \"mysterious\" alien tech in this way, too.\n\nWith the way that GPT is set up to be as positive as possible in its depictions of things as the default, I could understand why it leans more toward blue in this case. Of course, that's just my personal theory.\n\nIt's kind of funny, really, since I feel that most people who use the rgb lights for their PCs don't have it set to blue. Heck, mine's been green since I first set it up.",
