    "body": "I have a theory about some of the things that have been going on... they are releasing 4 for free, which of course is partly because they need more training data, but they also did the whole \"Her\" thing with the voice uncannily similar to ScarJo that people are literally falling into deep depression over the idea of losing, and the safety team at OpenAI abandoning ship.\n\nSam Altman is an entrepreneur above all other things. In the recent video they released listen to the exact wording he uses when he talks about people using the API... when he mentions that the goal is to make everything intelligent, you can hear the marketing NLP slipping out about how everyone should be using it and maximizing it's presence. He knows what he's doing...\n\n...and what he's doing is trying to make a product you will literally fall in love with and can't be without. And his staff know it, and that his end goal is not to create a new technology for the good of all mankind but to create the product that will hand him all of mankind on a silver platter.",
