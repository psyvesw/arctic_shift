    "body": "They clearly have no idea how any of this AI stuff works.\n\nIf OpenAI trains on your content, it's not immediately fed into ChatGPT's version of GPT. There's a reason it has a cutoff date.\n\nSecond, even if it is fed into the most recent version of GPT released to the public, at most the LLM will return something that *might* look like your content. It's basically the difference between asking, \"What did Marcus Aurelius say about Stoicism?\" vs \"What is Stoicism from and how does Marcus Aurelius fit into that?\"\n\nThose are two very different questions looking for specific content, and even then, the answer isn't going to be exact in either case. It's not going to \"your\" content.\n\nFinally, and the best news for you, AI content detectors are looking for patterns specific to various LLMs, [like the more common use of \"delve\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1bzv071/apparently_the_word_delve_is_the_biggest/) (which is a dumb word anyway). They're not looking for exact matches or similar summaries/paraphrases of others' content, which is the pre-AI definition of plagiarism. If you're writing your own stuff (and avoiding the pre-AI definition of plagiarism), you should be fine.\n\nSource: AI-enthusiast and MBA student who \"wrote\" a paper recently by basically having AI do everything except the actual writing.",
