    "body": "The minority of people working on AI are the brilliant researchers that developed the theory, math, and other core parts that led to the foundational models.  There are very few people in the world who can do that, just like there there are very few people who can play in the highest echelons of any demanding discipline.  We can't all be Einstein, and the majority of significant advances to human knowledge and capacity are achieved by the smartest of us.\n\nThe interesting thing is, at least for the current phase AI boom, the ivory tower academic portion of the wave is largely over.  The concepts behind transformer and diffusion models are largely understood.  The math is largely understood.  Most people working on AI now are working on implementation details - that is, they're taking the science and doing the engineering.  That's not to say what they're doing isn't impressive, it's amazing - and not to say that it can't result in staggering improvements, because it can - but it's not the same thing as the foundational research.\n\nOpenAI has done a reasonable job so far of trying to make the actual use of the models more accessible to people with less specialized training in machine learning and data science.  The GPTs are a great illustration of that, as is their API.  Those are things folks with more run-of-the-mill competence in computers can participate in.\n\nThe \"real\" open AI community is in open source, and that community is buzzing with activity.  Huggingface has over 1 million models uploaded to it!  There are many, many applications being developed that use AI models for all kinds of things.  My personal favorite is [Backyard.AI](http://Backyard.AI), which is a front-end mostly for llama-based models used for running them on local hardware.  I've watched it grow in the past year and it's been beautiful.  Small team of devs have made a big contribution to the accessibility of LLMs for anybody with a decent GPU.",
