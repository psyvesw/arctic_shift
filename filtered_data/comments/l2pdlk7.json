    "body": "Hmm fair enough. My understanding from AI research is that number one most experts don't know what they're talking about and are guessing and more importantly they are outside the NDA non disclosure agreement circle--which means they don't really know even all there is about how this tech works compared to the ones who invented it and even they can't speak freely about developments and what they know. \n\nGenerally speaking, an AGI should combine abilities from all types of models, it will have an LLM and also vision, coding, robotics, etc all basic modalities. All models have a neural network, so that's a given. However if only one model would produce AGI then I would expect it to be a LM because it's the closest to AGI already and language of some kind is the first task you need to be able to complete any other. \n\nThat's the extent of my personal knowledge on the topic however",
