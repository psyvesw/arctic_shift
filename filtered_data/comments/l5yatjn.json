I played around with it a bit when it first came out and then disabled it. I prefer just using the 'Custom Instructions' feature of ChatGPT or creating a new personal GPT for different projects. The GPTs have an instruction limit of 8000 chars which is much better than the 1500+1500=3000 limit of the main ChatGPT.\n\nI've seen a number of people trying to use the memory extensively on reddit complaining about all of their memories just disappearing one day. Also, since you can't edit memories, only delete them, they can be painful to work with.\n\nI think the memory feature might be a good idea for the casual user to make it seem more like a friendly AI companion, though.",
