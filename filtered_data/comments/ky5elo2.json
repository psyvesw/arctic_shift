    "body": "This is the reason AI image generation is still inadequate and may never be.\n\nAI is great if you don't give a shit about what comes out, or you only want to replicate existing work. It'll copy something just fine, and it will ad-lib things you didn't ask for just fine, but it will not follow exact instruction worth a shit.\n\nThere is just no way to convey precise direction without literally just constructing the image from scratch yourself. This is one of the major reasons it's so popular among art laymen, but so unpopular among artists. The former don't know enough to have a detailed vision in mind so output doesn't matter, but the latter do.\n\nIf AI were built by artists the very first user controls to be put in place would be lighting control, camera placement control, exposure control, colour palette control, you know, fundamental basics, but these are all still entirely absent in favour of vague and fairly unimportant stylistic mimicry because that's all non-artists know.",
