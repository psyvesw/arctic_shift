    "body": "I've always been seen as weirdo, because I'm VERY non-conformist. This is probably due to bullying in school and having principles.   \nMy girlfriend uses ChatGPT and other programs at work (She has a PHD). Honestly, I think it's too tempting and easy. These days, I could do half my work with some AI programs too (and ironically, my work is to teach AI), but honor/pride won't let me do that. I push myself to use the \"harder\" option, if given a choice, simply because I think it's important to keep a sharp mind. All the people I knew who were healthy up until their death kept a sharp mind and stayed busy. With too much AI, I see that it's far too tempting to let AI do everything. I don't like that. But friends scold me and say I'm a dinosaur and they KNOW it won't turn out this way (how could they know? They also didn't believe me when I predicted the current state of instant gratification addiciton 15 years ago).",
