    "body": "Excellent points, I think my definitions of pro/anti are skewed as I\u2019m just used to seeing polarized conversations. My definition of Pro is people wanting unregulated explosion of AI, letting companies just do whatever in terms of data collection and use of their models. And I suppose my understanding of Anti is someone totally against it (I get this feeling usually talking to older folks and usually due to fearmongering). \n\nTo me, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as easy since I\u2019m all for research and expansion of these fields but in an ethical manner. I don\u2019t want companies to have a carte blanche and set precedents on individuals data privacy and collections/use of the data. \n\nI guess overall I was trying to say I don\u2019t like the polarization on this \u201cdebate\u201d as I think it\u2019s pointless as the technology and its impact is already here and we should think of ways to make it benefit the majority instead of the minority.",
