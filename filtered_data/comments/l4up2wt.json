It might not have creativity as to \"think\" new stuff but I was more wondering if you have it try to solve something in many different methods in parallel and when it reaches a hiccup or problem it will try to solve it and so on until goal completed.

(for example by responding with json which an external software reads as an alert and sends user an email)",
