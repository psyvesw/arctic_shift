    "body": "At Work:\n\n* Github Copilot helps me by doing the tedious boring stuff (I am a software developer)\n* Throwing content (mainly code) at GPT4 and let it analyze it, e.g. showing me what leads to error messages\n* Brainstorming on some topic with GPT4 as sparing partner\n* Letting GPT4 explain topics to me\n* Image generation for presentations. This rocks actually, no more text-only snore-fest slides anymore.\n\nLanguage Learning at home:\n\n* Giving the LLM a list of vocabularies and let it tell a story that uses them\n* Giving the LLM a story and let it generate a vocabulary table with translations\n* Let it teach grammatical concepts\n* Vocabulary quiz\n\nTeaching buddies for my kids (e.g. a customized GPT for beginner level language learning learning for the older kid, a kid-friendly GPT for the younger one to practice reading, spelling and keyboard use)\n\nImage generation in general for personal use, e.g. designing birthday cards customized for specific persons or funny illustrations for current chat topics\n\nI don't know if it counts as AI, but in some circumstances I love speech recognition (and sometimes voice synthesis).\n\nAt home I mainly use self hosted LLMs (the Mixtral 8x7b is a quite good multi-lingual model) and stable diffusion.\n\nAt work it is Github Copilot, ChatGPT4 and Dall-e, all kindly provided by my employer that also encourages the use of AI based tools (and yes, also sells them as part of our products, e.g. for image inference).",
