    "body": "Well the government doesn\u2019t really use LLMs because it has very little use for them. But the government does use massive algorithms for data aggregation and analysis. So when the federal reserve wants to make a change they can simulate much of the economy in a sterile environment to see what that change may do. The government also has a huge amount of data analysis on web traffic monitoring many people on searches and online purchases, you might say \u201cwell that\u2019s way to much data to go through and you\u2019ll never find anything\u201d. To that I would say you\u2019re right so another massive algorithm is used to find patterns of certain purchases that may result in terrorism or weapons gathering/caching. You can see these effects if you\u2019ve ever seen a YouTuber syropyro and he was visited by the fbi after buying chemicals for a YouTube video. Pretty much the series of purchases set off a red flag and an investigation was launched. Mostly the government isn\u2019t doing much that\u2019s actually nefarious when using AI because what\u2019s the point. Mostly they use it to just try and make sense of the country and protect as many people as possible. In the future the government will add more robust models for economic monitoring and simulation and that will help but that\u2019s years away. They will also be adding in massive capabilities to have automated labs for research for the DOD, DOE, DARPA, and their respective partners. They are currently building a huge supercomputer array to prepare for the models.",
