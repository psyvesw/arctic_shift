    "body": "Based on your line of questioning, I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t thought this through. Everyone has access to Google but my family and coworkers still come to me for all of their IT challenges. All I do is Google and read, and try out what I read. And if that doesn\u2019t work, I google a different way, and try that. In this example, just replace chatGPT. I MEAN\u2026 Jesus Christ. If we\u2019re going down this rabbit hole. Everyone has access to a pencil, but some people know how to articulate their thoughts in a more coherent way. I mean\u2026 bro. Really? Everyone has access to a hammer, yet certain people learn how to build a fence. I mean\u2026 god damn bro. I\u2019m sorry. But are you serious with this question? I could go on for days on this tangent. People don\u2019t use tools effectively. Some people use tools more effectively. AI isn\u2019t some magic wand. It still requires a user with intellectual capacity to operate it. The majority of people I know have never tried chatGPT. And I\u2019m shouting from the rooftops all the time about how awesome it is. My mind is being blown away constantly by the new developments in AI. Yet, many people just don\u2019t know how to use it, won\u2019t attempt to use it, don\u2019t care to learn it, won\u2019t even download the app. One more time\u2026 are you serious with this question bro? \ud83d\ude0e",
