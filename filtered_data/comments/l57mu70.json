    "body": "Indeed very interesting, thanks for sharing. That being said, that's not what's happening here, right? On the paper, you'd have some visual task to solve and you'd give the LLM some tool to visualize the state of the task after some change. Then you'd prompt it to reason step by step and after each step, use the tool to generate the representation of the system after that step was performed so that the next step can be generated using this information. On this case you don't have this, you only have the text reasoning, so I'd say this is an example of Chain of Thought rather than Visualization of Thought.",
