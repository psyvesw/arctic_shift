    "body": "Innocent question but here is the answer. The only time that AI detection can work is if AI implements watermarks that only AI can detect, and that does exist, it's just 99.9% of the AI available don't and will never support this. AI detection at best is a coin toss, meaning it doesn't work and is a random yes or no. You say that they are increasingly accurate but this is false, they are 0% accurate because they have no means to validate it.\n\nOpenAI doesn't use any kind of watermarks. Hardly any AI does and it's basically an add-on that you opt-in for. Nobody cares to deal with this nonsense. Pandora's box has been opened and it will never close.\n\nAnyone relying on an AI detector is setting themselves up for liability issues, especially in education. People will need to learn to work WITH AI, rather than trying to work against the AI revolution. AI isn't going anywhere, it's here to stay.",
