    "body": "I just have 0 need for it as a college student.\n\nIts a chatbot. Sure it's cool to fuck around with it, I like seeing its limitations. But other than that there's literally 0 use in my life.\n\nSure I can use it to write emails, but I can just do that myself. And it's way quicker to do it myself than fuck around with GPT. Plus it doesn't right the same way I do, so it'd be very obvious (bonus points, I write so differently that I've never once been accused of using it to cheat. Even those AI detectors that are bullshit have never flagged me)\n\nI could ask it for ideas sure, but why wouldn't I want to come up with ideas myself? My whole field I'm going into is about coming up with ideas, so I wanna learn to do it that way. \n\nThe only use for it that I've ever been given that I *might* do was given to me by my math professor. Which is to use it to generate practice problems. But even then, it's wrong a lot of the time and generates impossible problems. \n\nThere's just 0 use for it in my life. So of course I wouldn't use it",
