    "body": "It is cool how good people are getting at instinctively recognising the lower effort ones, I also see it as AI without knowing why.\n\nMaybe the slightly different lighting, thicker shadows under the caps of the three on the left, down to their noses, whereas the one with the hair sticking out has no shadow. The transition from light to shadow on his belly also looks strange, as does the lighting where we can only see one guy's belly. Of course he could be standing next to a reflective surface, but there seems to be light coming from underneath and above.\n\nReally getting in to it, it has also basically given them identical man titties, and for the two guys on the right they are probably way too high up their bodies. \n\nThe way the t-shirts fold around the fat folds also just looks drawn, particularly on the t-shirt of the guy in the middle.\n\nFinally, as said elsewhere, there is no way none of these guys would have at least one logo or some sort of slogan featuring an American flag on their t-shirt.",
