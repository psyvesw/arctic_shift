    "body": "First of all, it depends strongly on the language. ChatGPT is very good with popular languages, like main European ones, Chinese,and is pretty good with relatively widespread non-western languages, like e.g. Swahili. But set your expectations very low for less common languages (at least in written form) like Malagasy  \n  \nI wouldn't rely on ChatGPT for teaching you language,, largely because for teaching a person you need to have a longer plan, see what things they are struggling with, etc. You could probably try and first ask it to produce a plan, then expand on larger sections, and then go through them one by one, and you'll probably learn something, but I can't vouch for how good it will be at it.\n\nThat said, there are two things it's reasonably well with (at least with common languages) - first, if you struggle to understand something and need more detailed explanations (e.g. some phrase you saw seemingly contradicts a rule you learned, or LuoDingo tells you that a particular phrase is a mistake but you don't understand why), GPT is quite good at explaining things - languages are one if its stronger points after all.\n\nAlso it's quite good for practicing. Just tell it that you want to practice language, and for each of your prompts in the language you are learning it should first respond to you in the same language in the style of everyday conversation and then list any mistakes you made in your native language.",
