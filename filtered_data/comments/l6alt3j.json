    "body": "The ones who are using LLMs regularly are the ones who are accustomed to thinking for themselves. That's the real paradigm shift.\n\nOur society, especially in the US, does not teach people how to think critically. Most think lazily and do the bare minimum. So whoever is adopting these tools are well ahead of the rest of society.\n\nI think it's going to be a generational shift. Because Gen Alpha being born in a world where these tools exist will likely be the ones to use them in ways our current generations can barely imagine. No offense to boomers or gen x out there, but I'd imagine people who grew up with media force-fed to them will have the hardest time ever adopting to AI.",
