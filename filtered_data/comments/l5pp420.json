    "body": "Not only that, I heard someone say something that made so much sense, I think the Primeagen, and as a student - it really calmed me.\n\nLLMs are amazing at things that are too random and hard to compute, for example determining what clothes someone wears and how exactly.\n\nBut their biggest problem is that they basically throw up a lot of words that they absolutely don't have any idea about what they are saying, natively at least.\n\nThat's why you can make ChatGPT generate you a great piece of code in mere moments, but if you ask it what's wrong with it's code - in many, if not most cases it will blabber sone non-sense and \"fix\" it in the wrong way.\n\nIt is great when it comes to \"collateral use\", but when it comes to precision - that's it's weakest point.\n\nIt seems that LLMs are far from being able to be precise in their work, if that even possible with how they work, and that's something that is needed in coding.\n\nThat's why they are great at creating little pieces of code, but are at the level of a kid when it comes to understanding it and being able to refactor it in meaningful precised ways.\n\nIf the industry will move to creating programs mainly with LLMs - the amount of bugs would be tenfold what it is now, and everything would probably be slow.",
