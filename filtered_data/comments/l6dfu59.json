    "body": "It doesn\u2019t matter how smart you are. Look, my teacher always used to tell me \"you are so dumb. You are the clown of the class\" and guess what? I\u2019m smarter than the teacher now.\n\nIf you genuinely want to make it in the field of AI, you need to change your mindset. Maybe you don\u2019t understand much of it now, but if you genuinely do your best and you want it the most, you will learn it and you will be smart at it.\n\nFor every skill I\u2019ve mastered: video editor, game development, coding, and social media marketing, I thought the exact same as you do. I\u2019ve learnt that you can master anything you want. It\u2019s not a matter of being smart. It\u2019s a matter of trying your best. If you don\u2019t want it enough, you don\u2019t try 100%.\n\nMy advice: believe in yourself. Believe that you can master anything you want. You are that guy. You can do anything that you genuinely put your mind to. It\u2019s never about being smart. It\u2019s about wanting it enough. If you think AI is what you want to do, go for it. There\u2019s no risk. Just jump in the field and start to learn slowly. Take one step at a time, and start small.",
