    "body": ">OpenAI\u2019s only product is a subsidized unprofitable API/UI wrapper around a model. You can\u2019t build a company off of a product that gets constantly bulldozed whenever a better model comes out.\n\nThis logic is flawed. It's like saying that IBM would be unprofitable in the 80's because of Moores Law making every product obsolete every 6 months. The profit potential is absolutely bonkers. Not just for OpenAI, of course, though. I'm not saying they own AI, not at all. But the profit potential is unlike anything I've ever seen tbh.\n\nI don't know why you are even bringing up the current GPT subscriptions in this context. The product is **not** the GPT subscriptions. The potential is in the partnerships. They are currently building models for pharmaceutical companies, publishing houses, car manufacturers, financial institutions and consulting firms, etc. etc. etc.",
