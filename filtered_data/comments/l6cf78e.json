    "body": "No, not even that. ChatGPT doesn't have the capacity to \"understand\" things the way we do. It can't reason, it can't follow any logical steps, even if you feed those steps to it.\n\nAll it does is see patterns in language. Imagine suddenly everyone started speaking in a language you don't understand. Eventually, you would notice that certain sounds usually go with others in a same sentence. And if you pay enough attention, you would notice that when one person speaks a given sound, another would most likely answer with another given sound.\n\nIf you learn those patterns, you should be able to give a somewhat correct answer when someone talks to you: you probably heard something like what they are saying before, so you just answer with the combination of sounds you heard the most as an answer to that. Notice how you never learned the language, you never made any logical connections; all you did is memorize sounds.\n\nAnd congratz, now you're someone who can answer questions without even knowing the language the question is being asked in, the language you're speaking, what the question actually is or even what you're answering. All you know is that some words usually go with others in a given context, and that's it.",
