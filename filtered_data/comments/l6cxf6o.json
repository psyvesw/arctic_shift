    "body": "Interesting. In other words, you were skeptical this was written by a human? For what it's worth, [here's the original comment I referred to in my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1csdsfg/chatgpt_is_the_most_amazing_invention_and_i_cant/l46j1kb/) so there's a \"history\" at least. Though I guess I could have had an LLM write that too lol.\n\nRegarding the \"Average human\" bit. \n\nThat was more a reference to the fact that I'm nothing special. I'm not particularly smart. In fact, I have some diagnosed cognitive deficits. But if you use the \"crutches\" appropriately you can augment yourself beyond just competence. Nothing that I've done is beyond the reach of anyone reading this.\n\nI've used a number of \"special educational needs\"-supports over the years. And something I've often said is that there are many many shitty ones. The good tools are usually distinguished by the fact that they don't just help a \"disabled\" person but realistically have the potential to support anyone that cares to use them. LLMs, AI, automation, etc all the have the potential to be such tools that can help everyone so I find it kind of sad to hear that most don't.",
