    "body": "Yesterday I went down a rabbit hole when asking it questions about the solar flares that cause the northern lights and ended up asking more and more about distances in space, orbits, other solar systems with multiple stars that orbit each other. I do the same with history, economic history and population changes, geopolitical changes over time etc \n\nBasically the same sort of curiosity that you get with Wikipedia clicking through articles except you're prompting where you go next and you're getting the tailored answer instantly. Much more like having a conversation with an expert and the best part is you can always ask the dumbest questions that you'd be afraid to in a lecture or something\n\nJust yesterday the response to one of my questions was giving an answer in Astoronomical Units. I'd heard of them, but never really asked what that unit measures, and if I was among peers I'd assume that people must already know or have a reference for these units. But I got to have the penny click in my GPT conversation that an astronomical unit is the distance from the sun to the earth (roughly, since been made a precise measurement) and then went further finding out the distances between other things in space, how loght speed works etc and I had this new found understanding of relative distance that I never would have had before because I've never thought to just ask what an Astronomical Unit is.\n\nNot the most exotic use case, but hugely enjoyable",
