    "body": "Right, this is really dragging so I'll reply then love you and leave you. \n\n  \nI don't get how a streamer is relevant to a convo about how academic achievement is gauged and I honestly don't think you'll convince me otherwise. A course is how you \\*prove\\* your competency and is how most people get their jobs. You can say \"I know health and safety, look at my job history\" but most companies want you to work within the legal framework to protect their own ass so you need an \\*accredited\\* course that demonstrates you understand the legal framework because you passed the course, which is independent. This is so fundamental it's honestly boring to write about. AI is not going to change this system, it's just trying to exploit it and ask for forgiveness rather than permission\n\nAI hallucinations are not the same as the ones we have in our brains. That's just the word we use for them. The remind me of how people used to fuck with google algorithm back in the day, making irrelevant stuff appear in search. My elon musk point was meant to be a theoretical example but I wasn't clear enough. Real examples of AI hallucinations are present everywhere, \\[this is a great article that goes in depth\\](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html) (it's on NYtimes but I was able to access it for free so might be available to all?)\n\nAt the end of the day, naval gazing about \"but, if you think about it, the human brain is just plagarizing\" is dull and I don't want to engage with it. Not when actual creators are losing their livelihood so stock holders can make bank.",
