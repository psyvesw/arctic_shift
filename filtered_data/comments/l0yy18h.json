    "body": "Maybe what they meant was that you need low level system access to do what the Rabbit R1 does, since it has to be able to perform actions by itself on behalf of the user. That's really it's only selling point of this type of device over an app at the moment.\n\nOf course, OpenAI has the money to do this. In fact they're already directly backing that pendant project, which seems somewhat similar (except better). \n\nBesides, I expect that this type of device that does actions by itself will also be obsolete in probably less than a year once Google/Apple implement the same functionality directly into their voice assistants or native app.",
