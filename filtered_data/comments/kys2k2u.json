    "body": "# I built a tool for the Evaluation of OpenAI Assistants. Would love to get some feedback. Thanks :)\n\nRecently, I had an interesting user call where the user wanted to evaluate the performance of OpenAI assistants.\n\n**The Use Case:**\n\n* Similar to a RAG pipeline, the user built an Assistant to answer medical queries about diseases and medicines.\n* Provided a prompt to instruct the assistant and a set of files containing supporting information from which the assistant was required to generate responses.\n\n**Challenges Faced:**\n\n* Had to mock conversations with the chatbot, acting as different personas (e.g., a patient with malaria), which was time-consuming for over 100 personas.\n* After mocking conversations, had to manually rate individual responses based on parameters like whether the response was grounded in supporting documents, concise, complete, and polite.\n\n**Solution Developed:**\n\n* **Simulating Conversations:**\u00a0Built a tool that mocks conversations with the Assistant based on user personas (e.g., \"A patient asking about the treatment of malaria\").\n* **Evaluation of OpenAI Assistant:**\u00a0Tool rates the conversation on parameters like user satisfaction, grounded facts, relevance, etc., using UpTrain's pre-configured metrics (20+ metrics covering use cases such as response quality, tonality, grammar, etc.)\n\n**Seeking Feedback:**\u00a0Currently seeking feedback for the developed tool. Would love it if you can check it out on:\u00a0[https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/assistants/assistant\\_evaluator.ipynb](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/assistants/assistant_evaluator.ipynb)",
