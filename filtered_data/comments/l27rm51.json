    "body": "Wanted to say this! I don't know why everyone is freaking out. I have been a teaching assistant to professors for 5 years, and as chatGPT came out we noticed that some students used it to do their work for them. Any student that gets sussed for AI is invited for a chat to talk about their work. \n\nYou don't even have to prepare for this talk, a quick conversation about your topic with some questions from the prof will immediately tell her if you wrote it yourself or if you used AI to write it. The students who use AI seriously do not know what they handed in at all. You'll be baffled at the shit some students try.",
