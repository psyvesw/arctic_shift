    "body": "It's a machine, it does it's thing and writes in its own style unless you specify it. We recognize that style as being AI or in some cases ChatGPT specific. It's not that different from 1 human writing the same amount of stuff. Their style will be noticeable too. I don't think that randomized styling is a thing that's easy to add, but then it raises the question, whose style should it adhere to? And when it comes to research papers, when I read one now, there are so many words and terms that makes me think it might be AI, but the reality is it got that from actual research papers that were in its training. It's interesting to see the rise in \"patterns\" and keywords, but I don't think it can be addressed as there aren't that many synonyms for them that would make a difference. I'm sure that someone at some point makes AI diverse enough in writing styles that we no longer notice.",
