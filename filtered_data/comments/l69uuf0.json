    "body": "The trouble with various gpt style tools is that (at least for my usescaases) at best they produce the kind of output that I would expect from a talented, but inexperienced intern which is fine for the mind of generic blurbs you see most digital marketing but it\u2019s completely undifferentiated and is exactly the kind of fluff most people have developed filters for \n\nLooks good, ranks ok (especially if you know how to prompt for SEO optimisation) and works ok for awareness but has pretty much zero impact on cut-through to consideration \n\nUsing RAG on deeply tech analyst material is a joke, unless the subject has been widely discussed over years with lots of good editorial content for it to learn from the result / analysis is  generic and  uselessly shallow \n\nIt\u2019s pretty good at aggregating and summarising insights from a well established corpus, but trying to get it to come up with genuinely new insights from data is asking too much, so it\u2019s back to doing things the old fashioned way",
