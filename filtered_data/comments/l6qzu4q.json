    "body": "I\u2019ll disagree with my experience in assistance of my maths assignment .\n\nSo one of my assignment requires me to use lagrange multipliers, and because the equations obtained, other than the original, constraint equafions, is very similar and I\u2019ll need to prove any relationhsip between the variables.\n\nI throw this to ChatGPT, it keeps beating around the bush and repeating what it said, even though I explicitly told the AI to solve it completely.\n\nJust for curiosity, I asked why 0 factorial is 1, and it gave me a long answer which I didn\u2019t even bother reading it, because it gave me a conclusion: it really doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s saying. In a more insulting term, it\u2019s a talking search engine.\n\nFrom the 0 factorial case, it gave a long explaination, which does suffice, but clearly there\u2019s an even more simple explaination that exists. I do recognize the things that AI is capable of, but intelligence is clearly not one of them.",
