    "body": ">there's lots of money focused on it.\n\nWhich have been true for a lot of failed products.\n\nI remember that startup working on a flying car back in the 90's and the problem has never been to make the car fly. These have been around for decades, they're called helicopters and that flying car was just a variation of it. The reason we don't all have one isn't the technology but that it's a massive amount of resources, nuisances and risk for a very limited gain compared to a regular car. Not worth it for 99% of travels.\n\nEvery technology hits its barrier where it plateaus doesn't evolve further. That's why we don't fly the fastest or biggest planes. \n\nI don't expect AGI to be different. Training an AI to make text or even videos is \"easy\" because we have an absurd amount of data to feed it to learn. But if you want it to be better than its teachers, you need it to be able to experience stuff on its own and that's going to be exponentially hard and expensive to do, at which point you have to wonder if it's worth the investment.\n\nMeanwhile, we already have the technology for AGI, it's called people and people are cheap to make. Sure, they're dumb-asses, but that's because they've been raised by other dumb-asses, just like our AIs.",
